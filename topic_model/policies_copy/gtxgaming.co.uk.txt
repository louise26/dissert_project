Terms and Conditions
1. Definitions.

2. Conditions
By purchasing any of GTXGaming's services you agree to the terms and conditions laid out in this document.
3. Services
3.1. The cost of a server subscription is valid through the entire rental of the server, subject to fair consumer price index increases.
3.2. All subscription users have the option to transfer to different products/services.
3.3. Dedicated servers may take up to 24 hours to set up but we hope that typically these should be set up in 12.
3.4. GTXGaming does not install add-ons for all games but GTXGaming support staff may help under certain circumstances and with certain games. Some help is achieved by support staff, that play the game, offering their own time-saving scripts to others. GTXGaming and staff members take no responsibility for the use of these scripts. Please use it at your own risk.
3.5. Service downgrades are nonrefundable. Downgrades occur the instant you make them.  Making downgrades towards then end of the month would be ideal.
3.6 Domain names held and registered by GTXGaming will be subject to a transfer out admin fee of 100% the cost of a 1-year registration. All domain names are held by GTXGaming on behalf of the client.  If your domain name is not renewed the client will get a 30-day cooling-off period in which to renew after which any party can re-register the domain name.
4. Payment
4.1. All game server(s)/dedicated server(s) are to be paid for in advance. Failure to keep up monthly payments on your server can result in suspension and ultimately deletion of your game server(s).
4.2. If you decide to cancel a subscription with us please also remember to cancel your PayPal subscription, which in some cases does not auto-cancel. GTXGaming is able to refund up all overpayments if the subscription cancellation script fails.
4.3. Should you need to raise a PayPal dispute the suspension of your service may need to be implemented whilst the investigation is progressing.
4.4. No personal credit or debit card details are retained by GTXGaming.
4.5. A monthly order counts as 30 days and GTXGaming provides a cooling-off period of 24 hours if the service is somehow not right for you we can refund you (excluding dedicated servers which we cannot refund unless there are hardware issues). After the 24 hours cooling-off period, refunds can be denied unless a manager feels a refund is justified. We always try to be fair in refund decisions so give us as much information as possible for the reason for your cancellation.
4.6. Due to price fluctuations caused by currency exchange rate changes, or price increase, or decrease for any reason, upgrades and downgrades are calculated using the latest price listed on our website, upgrades or downgrades done at any time are calculated based on today's prices for any given service.
4.7. Store credit is refundable at GTXGaming's discretion. This includes your credit balance and any donations received via public/clan pay.
4.8. Cancellations must be done via our portal. Go to My Services, choose the service you wish to cancel, and then request a cancellation.
4.9. Cancellations on quarterly, semi-annually, and annual orders will be subject to a £10 early cancellation fee. This is for the admin required to account for the refund and calculate and processing of early cancellation refund.
4.9.1. Credit stored on GTXGaming's billing area will automatically pay invoices that are due on any service that is not cancelled using this procedure https://help.gtxgaming.co.uk/en/article/how-to-cancel-your-service-with-gtxgaming-2ssuex/.
4.9.2. Cancellations before the end of the contract will cause the discount (5% Monthly, 10% Semi-Annually, 15% Annually) to be rescinded and added to the total cost of the server.
5. Communications
5.1. GTXGaming support staff are here to assist you. They will do their utmost to help within the confines of the support service guidelines (sometimes a little more). Please treat them with respect, it's much harder to fix an issue with overly abusive individuals. Under that kind of pressure, it's hard to help to the best of our ability. In the unlikely event they cannot help you they may be able to point you in the direction of information that you can then research yourself.
5.2. GTXGaming will contact you via your email to inform you of any downtime or maintenance required on your server. Please also note that there are scheduled restarts of our machines once a week although we do perform this at times of least use, normally 6am, and they will be down only for the time it takes to reboot. Servers will restart automatically.
6. Hardware and backups
6.1. Not all hardware is created equal and there will, inevitably, be some failures. GTXGaming have offsite backup stores and backups are performed at regular intervals. To help protect your files auto backup systems are in place and can be retrieved after a hardware failure.
6.2. There are script functions coded by GTXGaming in your control panel that you can use to manually back up your files or you can store your worlds locally with FTP access. GTXGaming cannot be held responsible for the loss or corruption of your files although GTXGaming will do everything possible to recover data in the unlikely event of a failure. GTXGaming also advises local backups.

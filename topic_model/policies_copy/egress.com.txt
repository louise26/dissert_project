The security and confidentiality of your personal information is very important to us.

We limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third-parties who have a business need to know.  They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.  Still, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

This may be by email or other electronic means available to us in the future. We may use other information available to us in order to tailor our communications.

If you or your business provide information to us about another person or business (such as Third-party data) you must make sure you have the right and permission to do so (e.g. by providing appropriate data collection notices to individuals who are the subject of Third-party data). We are reliant on this in order to receive and process the information you provide. By providing it, you confirm that you do.
Ownership of Third-party data: Once you have uploaded Third-party data to our partner portal, we hold that information (including any personal data within it) as a controller. You may yourself be an independent controller, not a joint controller, of some or all of that Third-party data. We are therefore free to use Third-party data for our own purposes and to determine when, how and where it is processed (subject to compliance with relevant data protection laws).

We share your information with these third-parties to help with our business activities and delivery of our services. They are only authorised to use your personal information as necessary to provide the services to us that we request from them and must abide by data privacy and security obligations set out in applicable law.
Where any transfer outside of the country or region that you are located in (e.g. the European Economic Area (EEA), the United States or the UK) occurs, we will ensure that any such transfer or processing is subject to appropriate legal and technical safeguards with our subcontractors in line with local law requirements.
Provision of Partner Portal: We use Salesforce, Inc. to provide both our Portal and the CRM system that information provided through it is stored on. Details about Salesforce’s approach to privacy
Transfer of rights: We reserve the right to transfer our obligations, rights and permissions in personal contact information and website data to any organisation to which we may transfer our business or assets (including if we, or a relevant part of us or our assets, are proposed to be purchased or acquired by a third party).
Selling your information: We will not, and do not, sell or rent your information to third-parties for: (i) valuable consideration (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act) or for their direct marketing purposes; or (ii) monetary consideration for the person to license or sell it to additional persons (as defined in Nevada Senate Bill 220). Your information may be shared with third parties as set out above for our business purposes, including the provision of services to you and/or your organisation or employer.
Applicable law: We reserve the right to disclose personal contact information and website data in order to comply with national, EU or Member State law to which we’re subject, including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements. You can find out more on our approach here.
What we need you to do
We need to make sure that the information that we hold about you is accurate, up-to-date and still relevant. As a result, we need you to tell us promptly if there are any changes to the information that you provide by letting us know at DPO@egress.com.
How long we will keep your information for
We will keep information in accordance with our data retention policies available at www.egress.com/legal, including to maintain records required for legal or regulatory reasons, to show that we complied with our contractual obligations, to respond to any complaints or queries, and for research and statistical purposes.
Your rights as an individual
As an individual user of our Sites, you may have certain rights by law in respect of the personal data that we hold about you. These rights may not always apply as your location and the basis on which we’re processing your personal data may affect their availability. You can find out more information about them and our Data Protection Officer at www.egress.com/legal/your-rights.
If you ever have a complaint relating to the delivery of our services, or our processing of your personal information, you can find details on how to raise this in our Complaints Policy at www.egress.com/legal.
Privacy Shield
We participate in the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks and have self-certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce our adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles for all personal information received from countries in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom in reliance on the Privacy Shield. To learn more about Privacy Shield, visit the Privacy Shield website at www.privacyshield.gov/list.
Under Privacy Shield, we are responsible for the processing of personal information we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party acting for or on our behalf. We are liable for ensuring that the third parties we engage support our Privacy Shield commitments. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has regulatory enforcement authority over our processing of personal information received or transferred pursuant to Privacy Shield. We commit to cooperate and comply with the advice of the regulatory authorities to whom you may raise a concern about our processing of personal information about you pursuant to Privacy Shield, including to the panel established by the EU authorities and the Swiss FDPIC. This is provided at no cost to you.
If you do not feel that we have resolved your complaint or concern satisfactorily you can contact our U.S. based third-party dispute provider (free or charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
International Privacy Verification
Whilst the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) ruled the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks invalid in the summer of 2020, we remain committed to the Privacy Shield Principles.  In recognition of our continued commitment, in October 2020 we self-certified with the International Privacy Verification programme (IPV). The IPV’s assessment criteria are aligned with those of the Privacy Shield and therefore by certifying with the IPV we are able to continue to demonstrate our compliance with the core Privacy Shield Principles in relation to the protection of personal data transferred outside of the UK and EU.
If you do not feel that we have resolved your complaint or concern satisfactorily you can contact our U.S based third-party dispute provider (free or charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
Cookies
To find out more about cookies and how we use them, see www.egress.com/legal/cookies. If you live in California, we need to let you know that some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites and online services you communicate with. Whilst there is no industry standard that governs what, if anything, we should do if we receive such a signal, our website will not set cookies if you have your browser set to ‘Do not track’
Changes to this policy
We can change this policy from time to time. You should check the website periodically to make sure that you have read our most recent policy. When we do make changes, we will change the date at the top of this document.

“To balance security vs ease of use is a real tightrope act, and I think the team has
done a great job at doing that well.”
Cy Fenton, Chief Security and Privacy Officer, Global Infrastructure, SVP Ralph Lauren
“Access to end-to-end encryption via Zoom will please a lot of people. It’s something
Teams doesn’t have, and it gives Zoom another game-changer to add to its feature portfolio.”
Kate O'Flaherty, Senior Cybersecurity Contributor at Forbes
“Zoom has become an essential service for Oracle. The way we work will never again be
the same. Going forward, professionals will meet sometimes face to face, and sometimes digitally via
Zoom.”
Larry Ellison, Oracle CEO
“It is my opinion that Zoom has set the bar for the entire industry
creating a product that is not only at least as secure as the competition, but also implements those
security capabilities in a way that doesn’t sacrifice usability and ease of use.”
Beyond the noise — 7 reasons it’s safe to run Zoom
by Rowan Trollope
“Today’s collaboration platforms demand the highest levels of security. Zoom has
developed a strong set of advanced security features for its easy-to-use platform that any user should
feel safe and comfortable deploying.”
Roopam Jain, Senior Director - ICT
“Zoom has done a great job building the industry’s easiest to use product while
ensuring best in class security. Zoom customers should feel confident they can continue to Zoom away and
their data won’t be compromised as Zoom takes security seriously.”
Zeus, Kerravala, Founder and principal analyst with ZK Research

Contractual: it is necessary in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract for employment. This relates to information that we collect as part of the application and selection process.
Legal obligation: it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation placed on us as the data controller - we are required to report on equality of opportunity; and onboarding processes have specific requirements
Public task: processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller. In this case, Civil Service Jobs facilitates recruitment of high-quality candidates to roles across government departments, agencies and other public bodies. It provides recruitment tools and processes that support Civil Service recruitment strategy, and we also monitor the effectiveness of recruitment processes.

When AccessNI is used
As an organisation using AccessNI to help assess the suitability of applicants for positions of trust, the Government Recruitment Service complies fully with AccessNIâ€™s Service Level Agreement regarding the correct handling, use, storage retention and disposal of Disclosure Applications and Disclosure information. We also comply fully with obligations under the Data Protection Act 2018 and other relevant legislative requirements with regards to the safe handling, storage, retention and disposal of disclosure information.
As we no longer receive a copy certificate from AccessNI, written consent will be obtained from the applicant when requesting and retaining a copy of a disclosure certificate. Disclosure information is kept securely, in lockable, non-portable, storage containers with access strictly controlled and limited to those who are entitled to see it as part of their duties. In accordance with section 124 of the Police Act 1997, disclosure information is only passed to those who are authorised to receive it in the course of their duties. We maintain a record of all those to whom disclosures or disclosure information has been revealed. We recognise it is a criminal offence to pass this information to anyone who is not entitled to receive it. Disclosure information is only used for the specific purpose for which it was requested and for which the applicantâ€™s full consent has been given.
Once a recruitment (or other relevant appointment, regulatory or licensing) decision has been taken, we do not keep disclosure information for any longer than is necessary. We comply with AccessNIâ€™s Service Level Agreement to return the original disclosure certificate to the applicant once a decision, recruitment or otherwise has been made and will be retained no longer than the agreed period.
Once the retention period has elapsed, we will ensure that any disclosure information is immediately destroyed by secure means. While awaiting destruction, disclosure information will not be kept in any unsecured receptacle. We will not keep any photocopy or other image of the disclosure or any copy or representation of the contents of a disclosure or any other relevant non-conviction information supplied by police. However, despite the above, we may keep a record of the date of issue of a disclosure, the name of the subject, the type of disclosure requested, the position for which the disclosure was requested, the AccessNI unique reference number of the disclosure certificate and the details of the recruitment decision.
Retention
Your personal data will be kept by us for the following durations:
Application records and associated files (including CVs, letters, emails, criminal history certificates, comment and feedback) will be deleted 2 years after the vacancy is archived.
A vacancy becomes archived when there are no active applications and either:
the vacancy is manually archived by a recruiter; or
the vacancy is automatically archived 1 year after the advertised closing date.
Candidate accounts - you can, at any time, choose to close your account. This will:
remove your ability to login to the account
withdraw any active applications
delete partially-completed applications which havenâ€™t been submitted
disable the automatic sending of job alerts
Closed accounts are deleted and cannot be restored, however previously submitted applications will be retained until deletion for the period described above.
Candidate accounts that are active will remain in the system unless the candidate deletes them (or makes a request for deletion). An account will become inactive if the user has not logged in for two years.
Vacancy manager accounts
ATS account holders are required to periodically reconfirm that they still require access, otherwise the account will become inactive.
Inactive accounts will be deleted three years after the last time the user logged in. Active accounts will remain in the system.
Automated decision making
Your personal data will be subject to automated decision making when online psychometric tests are used.
Some vacancies use online psychometric tests in the early stages of recruitment.
Three tests are commonly used: Verbal Reasoning, Numerical Reasoning and the Civil Service Judgement Test.
Decisions are made on who to invite to later stages based on automated scoring and sifting processes.
In addition, test scores and other applicant data are regularly captured for statistical and research analysis purposes.
Your score is calculated from the responses you give during the test, and no other information about you is used.
We compare your score to those gained by a peer group who previously took the test, to give you a percentile. The vacancy will have a minimum percentile requirement, and if your score is lower than this, you will be rejected and your application will not be considered further.

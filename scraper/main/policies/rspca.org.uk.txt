Rehome a
pet
How to rehome
Rehome a pet
Most of our rehomed pets aren't puppies or kittens. They're loud, quiet, fluffy, big, small, or even three-legged. They come with a personality ready-made, a past that's unique to them and a lot of love to give. Can you give one of our animals the happy future they deserve?
Rehome a horse
How to rehome a horse
Rehome a horse
We have lots of horses and ponies waiting to be rehomed throughout England and Wales right now - ranging from adult ridden and companion horses to youngsters who will need bringing on in their new homes.
Foster an animal
Horse fostering
Foster an animal
Many animals that we take in have either suffered or are not used to the care and affection that they deserved. Living with a foster family helps to provide them with one-to-one care, allowing them to build up their confidence and get used to a normal lifestyle.

Lab animals
People often disagree as to whether they think animal experiments are necessary, useful or justified, and to what extent non-animal alternatives are available. We believe that every area of animal use should be judged individually and that replacing the use of animals with humane alternatives must be the principal goal.

Animals you can no longer see
Animals on the road
Wildlife
We class 'wild animals' as those that are not normally domesticated. The list is enormous, ranging from badgers to nesting birds, pet snakes and zoo elephants!
Our concern for wild animals is based on how they are treated and whether humans cause unnecessary suffering - rather than how many of a species there are.
Litter
Fishing litter
Sky lanterns
Alternatives to balloons and sky lanterns
Litter
We receive around 5,000 calls a year regarding litter and unfortunately, our wildlife are the main victims when it comes to people's rubbish - particularly wild birds.
On average we receive 14 calls a day about animals affected by litter and these calls spike in the summer months.

We provide advice and support to people using, or thinking of using, animals in any production environment.
Following good welfare practice not only reduces risk to a production, but protects animals and helps those using animals to stay within the law.

Most of us can't imagine how anyone could be cruel to animals. Here at the RSPCA, we
believe that animals, from crustaceans to cows, are sentient beings with feelings and
emotions.
Since cruelty is on the rise in the summer, we are calling on everyone to take a stand.

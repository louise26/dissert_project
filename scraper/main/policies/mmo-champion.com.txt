When Mass Dispel dispels multiple targets, the order of dispels is now random.
Dungeons and Raids
Sanctum of Domination
Defeating Sylvanas on any difficulty will now always drop a Shard of Domination for players who do not yet have all possible Shards.Remnant of Ner’zhul
The pendulum around the Penance of the Fallen King swings once again.
Mythic+
Fixed an issue that could cause small discrepancies in how Mythic+ Rating is displayed in different User Interface elements.
Items and Rewards
Shards of Domination
Scouring Touch no longer incorrectly removes stealth type effects from the caster when applied to targets.
The amount of Anima dropped by bosses in the Sanctum of Domination is now affected by achievements earned by upgrading your Covenant Sanctum.The Treatise: The Study of Anima and Harnessing Every Drop should now work on Korthia dailies, rares, and treasures as well as the Covenant Maw Assault quests.
Developers’ note: The original goal was for the Treatise items to give you bonuses when returning to the 4 non-Maw zones or to the Maw proper for the Stygia Treatise. Korthia was themed to be part of the Maw during development and so it was not included. However, since we didn't clarify that well and Korthia is abundant in Anima having not originated in the Maw, we are enabling this item's bonus there as well. Looking forward, the Treatise: Relics Abound in the Shadowlands awarded at Tier 6 with The Archivists' Codex only works on the four original zone factions as a bonus to players who want a way to speed up their reputation with these factions.
The new socket adding item, Alloy-Warping Facetor and conduit upgrade item, Death-Bound Shard should now be purchasable by all characters on your account from Archivist Roh-Suir once one character has reached Tier 6 Research.Rae'shalare, Death's Whisper is now classified as a Unique item.Fixed an issue that was causing the Foresworn Aspirant's Robes to not show up in the Kyrian Soulbind dailies or in the Transmog appearances user interface.
Quests
Resolved a number of issues with the quest "The Nathrezim" in which Mal'Ganis was telling enemies in other player's experiences what to do. He has been notified to stay in his lane.Added a graveyard that is specific for the quest "The Nathrezim."
Developers’ note: This should eliminate the long run back to the quest if it is in progress and reduce some of the timing bugs that were coming up with Mal'Ganis' gloating moments.
The Maw
Fixed an issue where players who accepted a queue in the middle of flying to the Beastwarrens would be pacified until relogging.
Torghast
Completing the Adamant Vaults will now always reward Anima and significantly more gold.Bosses in the Adamant Vaults no longer regenerate health after defeating players.

Race to World First: Sanctum of Domination
Guilds are getting even closer to a Sylvanas kill! Assuming the encounter ends at 45% health, Complexity Limit got less than 1% away from a kill earlier tonight.

Orbs of Torment should no longer be able to sneak in a melee attack.
Painsmith Raznal
[With regional restarts] Floor spikes created by Instruments of Pain now inflict their damage more closely aligned with the visual effect of the spikes on all difficulties.
Guardian of the First Ones
[With regional restarts] The Physical damage portion of Obliterate is now correctly increased by Obliterate’s vulnerability effect, and Obliterate’s vulnerability effect has been increased to 5000% on Heroic and Mythic difficulties.
Developers' note: On Heroic and Mythic difficulties, the Guardian's Sunder and Obliterate combo is meant to be shared between two tanks. Prior to this change, stringing together multiple immunity effects could allow a single tank to survive the entire encounter; this should no longer be possible. Our goal is to avoid a scenario where the optimal strategy for the encounter involves having only a single tank, unlike all other encounters in Sanctum of Domination.
Kel'Thuzad
[With regional restarts] Soul Shards will no longer despawn if the target of Soul Fracture is defeated prematurely.
Sylvanas Windrunner

Sylvanas Encounter Doesn't End at 50%, Echo's Platform Strategy Hotfixed

Sylvanas Encounter Doesn't End at 50%
Echo have brought Sylvanas down to 49.57% health, confirming that the encounter does not end at 50% health.
According to a hotfix implemented on July 6, it looks like the fight is supposed to end at 45% on Mythic difficulty: Sylvanas

Echo's Platform Strategy Hotfixed
After coming up with a plan to push for more damage on Sylvanas, Echo's new platform strategy was quickly hotfixed.
In their new strategy, Naowh would go alone on the left platform in the last bridge split and survive tanking the Mawforged Colossus until Jaina teleported everyone to Oribos. This would let the rest 19 players save all their cooldowns for Sylvanas, instead of wasting them on adds.
After about an hour of using this strategy, Blizzard pushed a hotfix that makes the Mawforged Colossus get the Berserk buff after ~45 seconds. In the video below Naowh gets 1-shotted, and since there is no one else nearby, the Mawforged Colossus casts Hymn of the End and quickly wipes the raid.

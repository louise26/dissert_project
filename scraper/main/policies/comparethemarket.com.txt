Marketing Cookies
Marketing Cookies record your visit to our website, including the web pages you have visited, the links you have followed, when you visited the website and your IP address and device ID. We use carefully selected and approved advertising and marketing providers (as set out in the table below) to help us to serve our advertising to users. These providers will set targeting cookies on our websites and will use them to make sure that our advertising that they serve to you is relevant to your interests and needs. These cookies collect information about your web browsing activity and allow our providers to track you when you visit different websites, so that they can serve our advertisements to you on those websites. For example, if you visit our homepage but didn't obtain a quote, the cookie will collect this information and serve you an advertisement on a different website to encourage you to come back and get a quote. Our providers control these cookies and are responsible for how the cookies, and any information collected by the cookies, are used. None of the information collected by the cookies is shared with us.
Although these cookies do not collect information that you enter into forms on our website (such as your name and email address), we sometimes share your email address, IP address and information about whether or not you have purchased a policy or claimed a reward with our providers. Information is shared in an encrypted form and our providers can combine this information with the data that their cookies collect to serve our advertisements to audiences that we select.
We and our providers also use targeting cookies to:
improve our website, for example by enabling us to understand how our customers interact with our website;
evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions on third party websites, for example by tracking whether these advertisements are clicked on by customers and how many times;
inform the content of marketing emails that we send to you and trigger those emails, where we have your consent to send you these emails. For example, if you have looked at pet insurance quotes but not taken out a policy, these cookies may trigger an email to you to remind you of your quotes and encourage you to come back and take out a policy; and
trigger service support communications to you.

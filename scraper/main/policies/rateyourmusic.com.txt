The Asymptotical World EP (2021)
Yves Tumor

LIGHT CORAL
For a guide to the review color rating system, click
here.Pardon the pun, but Yves Tumor’s career has been defined by growth: morphing from a formless mashing of harsh noise, alt-based brooding and sensual textures into something that rests just, just outside the bounds of what you could reasonably conceive of as pop. Last year’s Heaven to a Tortured Mind may not have been their most even work, but it was their most accessible by far, its dips into Isley-like song structures and emotional resonance helping the enigmatic artist garner a larger audience than ever. The Asymptotical World EP, surprise-dropped in mid July, will greet those new fans with an equally-tactile serving of guitar-centered luxuriance. Its six songs demonstrate everything Tumor has established themselves for: mantric lyrics, visceral production, the thin cord they straddle between breakthrough and breakdown.Where Heaven leaned into the golden era of FM soul and glam, Asymptotical looks back to a period slightly more recent: the icy, brittle feel of early- and mid-2000s’ alternative. Previously-released single “Jackie,” which crosses Tumor’s emotive vocals with starry guitars that smear and scrape across the ears, hits like a freight train. “Secrecy Is Incredibly Important for the Both of Them” rides a talking hi-hat pattern and a surging bass line like classic Bloc Party; “Tuck’s” exploration of power dynamics features NAKED’s Agnes Gryzckowska over industrial clang and filtered harmonics; “…And Loyalty Is A Nuisance Child” opens in a garage and flows into an arena, the sheer size of its guitars almost too much to contain. It’s weird to think that the sounds are beginning to feel nostalgic, and yet so much of this EP feels pulled from what was bubbling amongst the blogs of nearly two decades ago, when rock was simultaneously starting to get both its dance groove and its sense of emergency again.Yves Tumor continues to be an incredible producer; they, along with co-producers Yves Rothman and Chris Geretti, fashion the EP as a near-overwhelming sensory experience by pushing each instrument to its limits. It’s almost maximalist how far they go to make a simple track like “Crushed Velvet,” with its simple chord strums and 4/4 beat, into a celebration of expression through garment, or how they push the drum part on “Katrina” so that each kick drives into the ears like an erratic heartbeat. Meanwhile Tumor’s lyrics remain less poetic than prosaic - repetitions that replicate the dynamics of an obsessive mind - and while that occasionally makes them feel a little unfinished at first exposure, the approach works because Tumor designs their songs to be circuitous, moment-based dioramas instead of unspooling tales. There’s nary a resolution to be found in an Yves Tumor song, just a bloodletting accompanied by varying levels of pain and ecstasy.We’re likely well past this point now, but the EP format used to serve some form of utility for an artist; perhaps they wanted to provide holdover material during a dry spell, or to signify a change in their sound, or to experiment with a new direction without committing to a full length. It remains to be seen where The Asymptotical World sits in this spectrum, especially considering how this material feels like a natural expansion of what Tumor’s now known for. As an individual release though, this EP continues the hot streak belonging to one of America’s hottest-burning talents.Recommended for wherever red and blue spotlights meet.[High A // Mid O // Mid I]

Maturity and Responsibility.
As a big fan of Claire's work, it's so satisfying to hear an album like this. Immunity is by no means an immature album, but Sling shows a newfound sense of maturity to the lyricism that really helps it feel like a follow-up. This album is a collection of Claire coming face to face with different realities- the good and the bad. Even through the brutal challenges, Claire finds a light at the end of the tunnel; her journey of self exploration unravels into the pages of this tale. Her lyrical abilities have improved so much, breathing a new life into her work, while still feeling wholly like a Clairo album. She's really come into her own as an artist on Sling, and as a fan since the very beginning, five years ago or so, it's cathartic for me, and no doubt even more so for Claire. Wonderful album.

Tkay Maidza Cements Herself As A Star Of Tomorrow On ‘Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 3’
It can be difficult to bounce back from errors, especially when people can’t recognise why something works or doesn’t, to begin with. But, that leniency is to be expected from Tkay Maidza by now. Forever shapeshifting, she, along with an exclusive breed of alt-pop star, are changing the face of pop. Her debut LP ‘TKAY’ tried to do it all single-handedly, but couldn’t find the clarity to prove the hybrid could work. It wasn’t until she leapfrogged the competition in the midst of a renaissance of all things weird and wonderful on her ‘Last Year Was Weird’ series that she cemented herself as one of the most ingenious creatives of her time. And on its third, and final installment, she arrives fully-formed. The only thing that can even keep up with her turbulent talents on ‘Vol. 3’ is time itself, and per usual she does everything she can to tip-toe around that.There’s no overarching narrative to ‘Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 3’, but that’s the beauty of it. Every single second is connected only by a common goal to recreate the pandemonium, sullen vulnerability, and then anarchy, again, of a title that couldn’t be more accurate in this time of crisis. The polished exterior of ‘Eden’ and ‘Onto Me’, with UMI, give Maidza breathing room to rehearse her encyclopedic repertoire with ease. She skates between soothing melodies to shades of Missy Elliot’s peppery pastel pronunciation, and even exhaustion delivered with a despair-ridden attitude, with assertion. The perfectionist segues between jagged fragments of song and styles as they collide using her self-sure confidence as a glue, even pausing to cooly levitate atop the crop of ‘80s dance-pop on ‘So Cold’, a probable post-COVID party anthem, that has re-entered the spotlight.Unpredictable as ‘Vol. 3’ may be, it prioritises effectiveness over the sheer vastness of its content. In the past, Maidza has run herself ragged, allowing both good and bad experiments to slip through the cracks. As a result, ‘Vol. 3’ minimises the chances of spiraling. Even then, ‘High Beams’, the biggest surprise across all three installments, manages to simulate sitting through a cult initiation and space travel in a two and half minute window. Those looking for the warm embrace of the most sombre moments from ‘Vol. 1’, have plenty here, too. Maidza, more mature than ever, isn’t afraid to expose the chinks in her armour on ‘Cashmere’ as she pokes at the open wound left from a sour break-up. ‘Breathe’ doesn’t hit you in the face like it’s competition either, but it doesn’t try to. It strips the genre down to its barebones, an aching voice, elasticated synths, and a longing for something more concrete, before she bows out on “Can we just stay here?” in a quiet retaliation to everything she’s fought to attain this platform.Even the shakiest moments on ‘Vol. 3’ have something to offer. Granted, it can feel like the focus here has shifted from the ever salient Maidza to the absurdity of the production. In particular, ‘Syrup’ struggles to cope with the change of pace. Maidza is easily forgotten as the weight of the shingled vibrations of a druggy synth and gnarly drums crumble on top of her withdrawn syrupy tone. It magnifies her chameleonic character, but at what cost? Conversely, Maidza and Yung Baby Tate, harnessing the force of a stampeding herd of bull, are as ferocious, if not more unhinged, than the sinister bass that underscores ‘Kim’. The pair are so blind with rage, in fact, that they rarely take note of how unbearable the looped hook can be. That stubbornness can be grating, but it's never persistent enough to ruin a dozen good things the weak links have going for them.‘Vol. 3’, unlike its predecessor, slows down to admire a landscape Maidza has helped build from the ground up. That EP was like a whirlwind of audio that passed before you had time to even process what had hit you. The final chapter, shackled by the same time limit, feels more accessible, yet never lets you calculate its next movement. Maidza’s many faces can now, finally, be understood, as she spearheads a vanguard into superstardom. ‘Vol. 3’ is a blueprint that, although near-inimitable, can work, if you have the raw talent to work around it. And as Maidza closes this chapter in her career, she opens the door to aspire to something, somehow, even bigger. Whether it be another full-length album or, again, reshaping the infrastructure of pop, she’s well on her way to taking the title of the next true trailblazer.

Drawn and Quartered
Review by
wehopeyoudie
Seattle based death metal veterans Drawn and Quartered return with another taut punch of drab chaos. I’ve always likened these guys to an Incantation if they were stripped of all doom elements. The meditated discordant riffs, the angular shifts in tempo, the undercurrents of dissonance, all are rendered with a commitment to relatively straightforward composition despite their implied complexity. Many of the traits of technical death metal are there, but Drawn and Quartered insist on keeping the package relatively straightforward and uncluttered. There is an undulating sense of motion to their style that speaks of ordered chaos unfolding in real time unlike more frantic iterations of death metal which swamp the listener with information overload.Drawn and Quartered are not afraid of a blast-beat or thrash tempo, but the overall presentation is framed by riffs defined by their patient deliberation and conscious placement within each track. Even during the faster passages the riffs are easier to follow, simple but not simplistic in their developments and transformations.The production holds few surprises. This is a slick, polished mix of chunky guitars not lacking in edge, especially considering the frequent appearance of high-end harmonies or screeching leads that adorn the entirety of ‘Congregation Pestilence’. The prominence of these understated guitar leads also gives the album an atmospheric quality, a tone of mourning by way of commentary on the dirty chaos below. Drums offer a tight, patient, varied rhythmic framing for these pieces. During the slower passages the patterns are complex and dense, with double bass drums and crash cymbals defining many of the breakdowns in their twists and turns. Vocals are the traditional guttural style. Although offering not much beyond the typical for death metal, they add a welcome atmospheric texture that falls into a call and response relationship with those minimal lead guitars, a neat pocket of contrast within a densely packed musical space.Drawn and Quartered build these tracks from one central riff which is then driven through several variations of tempo, additional dissonance, soaring lead guitars, and shifts in pitch. Development riffs are rarely introduced. Whilst completely typical for death metal, this approach allows them to dress the dirt simple as complex, repetition poses as evolution. It looks like technical metal, but compositionally speaking this music could not be simpler. It is within the arrangements themselves that complexity is to be found, with drums and layered guitars crafting new and novel musical artefacts upon a fixed central motif. This is indicative of an older artist, completely comfortable in their chosen field, maintaining their identity whilst simultaneously showing no signs of growing stale or contrived. ‘Congregation Pestilence’ is an impressive act of unapologetic self-preservation.

Papangu
Review by
WattPheasant
An incredibly musically ambitious album that is executed as well as it is envisioned. 7 years in the making, Holoceno combines progressive sludge metal with elements of avant garde and zeuhl.
Imagine that every album that has ever been made was to be represented by various pebbles. This would make the world of music a seemingly endless dune of rocky, sandy clutter. When one decides to shovel deep into the figurative sediment of any genre they love, they will soon come to the grim realization that the majority of albums out there rarely ever reach the light of day; buried by time and competition. They will make small contributions to an established scene, and are added to the layered sediment that makes up this vast ocean of music. It comes down to how often these bands are dug up and listened to that makes them stay afloat. This is why I do what I do. My goal is to dig deep into this ground of music to uncover the lost gems that have been buried under the thick clutter of music. Additionally, to help fresh gems stay buoyant while they have that shot at getting the recognition they deserve before time passes them by.And speaking of fresh gems, we have this album. Holoceno is a debut album that has had seven years in the making, and unlike Fear Inoculum, the amount of time that has been spent perfecting this album did not result in a bloated product by any means. To cut to the chase, Holoceno essentially checks most of the boxes of what I am looking for in a new progressive metal album. It is impressively innovative and has stepped in grounds no other band has done successfully before. It contains incredibly creative songwriting, jaw-dropping instrumental solos, and technical musicianship. Its riffs are both effective and aplenty. The rhythm section in this album is almost unmatched by most other bands in general. It is mixed and produced appropriately. And the subject matter attempts to shed light on issues that are of greater importance than any one of us. What I can tell about the concept of the album is that it is an occult story of a bandit who sees a vision of his inevitable demise which caused a domino effect that will lead to the upcoming destruction of the entire planet via ecological collapse. He then tries to make a devilish pact with a mysteriously powerful figure to change the course of fate. The story feels very "Pandora's Box" themed, and is also where we get this absolutely amazing, ugly, yet beautiful album artwork.As the band has stated, their album is inspired by Brazilian modernist literature, as well as "ecological eschatology", meaning that the ultimate theological fate of humankind lies on us destroying the world's ecosystem through centuries of industrialized abuse to the plants, animals, and other life forms of the Earth, which will result in our end as well. The combined forces of mass negligence and greed of the rich and powerful will lead us to destroy our home, which will hinder our chances of survival in the unforgiving cosmos. It seems like the progressive metal albums that have been coming out of Brazil have been especially politically motivated as they are at the epicenter of the Holocene Extinction through the Bolsonaro administration and in burning the Amazon rain forest. This gives the album great historical significance as a piece of art.If one were to try and categorize this album into genres, I think they would find influences in the following in order: sludge metal, progressive metal, zeuhl, avant garde, and progressive rock. Before doing research for this band, I had been fairly familiar with most of these genres except for zeuhl. This is where I had begun a small detour into the zeuhl essentials so that I could figure out what this sound was that I was hearing in Holoceno that I could not yet distinguish. The band mentioned that Magma was a significant influence on their sound. The super jazzy and grandiose rhythms from zeuhl really show in a big way on Holoceno, which makes it a strange first couple listens for those who are not familiar with the genre. Other influences the band had mentioned were King Crimson and Mastodon, which make sense. The overall sound of the album is very dark, angry, and at times, mournful. And what better way to portray sad and angry music than with that thick, fuzzy, sludgy overtone. The kind of riffs you get on this album are often similar to what you might find from a Bizzaro World of Mastodon's Remission. Additionally, the King Crimson influence shows in their proggy, staccato rhythm sections.The only other two albums out there that I could find (and I looked fairly thoroughly) that combine sludge, avant garde, and zeuhl are Great Sage, Equal of Heaven by Guapo, and Volume Obliteration Transcendence by Yeti; both were released over 15 years ago. This confluence of genres is something that is incredibly difficult to pull off, and from listening to the two albums back to back it is evident that neither of them did it even close to as successfully as Holoceno. This is partly because Holoceno is produced exceptionally well compared to the other two, but I think it is more because Papangu wrote their songs around more progressive metal focused values where the others did not. What I mean by this is that the songs are built on very strong, odd time-signature riffs, where the compositions build to their climaxes with guitar, synth, or saxophone solos. The other albums focused more on building dissonant atmospheres and more noise-rock guitar chords, not a lot of riffs. By combining the previously mentioned genres with progressive metal, Holoceno becomes the first of its kind.I'd also like to mention the high level of musicianship that this album presents. The main members of Papangu are well-practiced, and every performance in this album is stellar. The guest musicians on this album also do an incredible job. Uaná Barreto plays the synth solos on "Bacia das Almas" and "Água Branca", and Luis Souto Major plays the dark synth on "Holoceno" for atmosphere. The last two tracks have amazing saxophone performances by Benjamin Mekki Widerøe, from the jazz fusion prog band Seven Impale. However, if any musician takes the cake on Holoceno it would have to be Torstein Lofthus the main drummer of Shining - Blackjazz. He simply plays on another level which is something you need to hear to believe.So far this is the most innovative album I've reviewed. And it feels good to say that it is executed just as well as its vision intended it to be. This is not just an ordinary piece of music that gets released and is forgotten, it genuinely feels like a historical piece of art. Both for breaking new ground in the music world and for its political undertones regarding our fate as a species. Holoceno is fit for fans of progressive sludge, or anybody that likes prog metal that strays on the darker, grittier side of things. For fans of avant garde metal, this is an essential underground album, and for fans of zeuhl/metal fusions it almost does not get better than this. Show Papangu some love!

Amenra
Review by
frenchie
Camden Town, London, May 2019. In celebration of Amenra’s 20th anniversary and one of the metal genre’s most crushing and intense acts, the Belgians take residency in England’s capital to perform headlining acoustic and heavy shows. Across two unforgettable nights I bear witness to two very different sides and shades of Amenra, both so captivating, atmospheric and intense in their own ways. For their acoustic show, the quintet perform with gentle alluring folk guitars, violin accompaniments and Colin H Van Eeckhout’s haunting, delicate and understated singing. Yet the night after I am overwhelmed by a surge of painstaking post-rock build ups, monumentally earth shattering sludge riffs and Van Eeckhout’s wild, pained and feral high-pitched screams. These are the memories I’ve held dear in the absence of live music and found reignited by the power of Amenra’s latest studio opus, De Doorn.Their first studio album not be part of the Mass (I-VI) titled series, De Doorn (The Thorn) feels like the start of a new chapter for the Belgian post-sludge masters, with some important changes coming to the fore. De Doorn is Amenra’s first album to be penned entirely in their native Flemish, and their first for legendary US metal label Relapse Records. Amenra also introduce new bassist Tim De Gieter, who not only makes their first studio outing as a performer, but has produced and recorded the entire album too. But most exciting of all, Caro Tanghe of fellow Belgian Church Of Ra post-black-metallers Oathbreaker adds both clean and screamed vocals across the entire record. The result of these changes has lead to Amenra’s biggest, most comprehensive and ambitious studio work yet that successfully builds more and more onto what they have already accomplished.Sure, the blueprints of Amenra haven’t changed a great deal. They’re still making lengthy atmospheric sludge tracks that slowly unfold with the pacing, dynamics and gradual build ups you’d expect from post-rock bands, with just as much attention to texture, atmosphere and ambient qualities. Their knack for luring the listener through patient, eerie clean guitar passages into riff explosions and howling vocals is still as sharp as ever too. Yet these elements feel heightened and more fine-tuned than ever through De Gieter’s excellent recording and production. The guitars sound monolithic, the drums pound and stomp the ground, and Van Eeckhout’s screams are more prominent in the mix than ever, no longer shielded behind their fellow performers. ‘Ogentroost’ continues a streak of fantastic Amenra album openers and is one of their finest yet, plunging the listener deep into a dream with low rumbling dark ambient drones that ever so gradually creep up in volume. A long clean guitar wanders through the fog like a beacon of light gently tiptoeing towards you. CHVE’s spoken word narration will get you on the edge of your seat as the band burst into life with doomy riffing and primal wailing. However, the addition of Tanghe’s dreamy, ethereal chants add a welcome new dimension that helps Amenra to stray from their typical formulas.Speaking of Caro Tanghe, their contributions and performances across De Doorn add an extra string to Amenra’s bow, complimenting Van Eeckhout’s own powerhouse performance so well, and at times even threatening to steal the show. Through a combination of clean singing vocals and blackened screams, Tanghe feels like an equally matched sparring partner for Van Eeckhout to vocally trade off with. The two vocalists allow each other plenty of space to shine individually, in their quietest moments offering compelling spoken word narratives and murmured singing sections; but as De Doorn‘s most incredible offering ‘Het Gloren’ reaches it’s bone-chilling, spellbinding finale, the two go full guns blazing, screaming intensely at each other as if to find post-metal’s bleak and harrowing answer to Sonny & Cher. The closing chapter of this song alone may just be Amenra’s most gripping and fiery moment in their entire discography thus far.By the time you reach De Doorn‘s spectacular finishing track you may feel exhausted and shook to the core in the most positive way. Not because the album is tiresome, but because you’ve gone through such a journey; such a physical ordeal where musicians throw everything at you and conjure every ounce of sweat, blood, tears, lung capacity and then some. It’s fitting that Amenra leave us on something of a calm, with ‘Voor Immer’‘s first half sounding more serene than anything before it with sparse clean guitar arpeggios and restrained spoken word from Van Eeckhout, allowing you to catch your breath just enough before one last gut punching conclusion.

61 year old (59 at the time of this things release) veteran video game composer, Hirokazu Tanaka drops his proper standalone debut album under the name "Chip Tanaka". His composition credits include Metroid, Super Mario Land, Kid Icarus, Dr. Mario, and perhaps most famously, both of the first 2 Mother games....Aaaand no one seems to care?Seriously, I was completely unaware this album had even dropped, if someone told me that the man partially responsible for the Earthbound soundtrack was legitimately about to drop a wonky/glitch hop album before this came out I'm pretty sure I would have immediately generated enough saliva to fill an olympic swimming pool.This is shockingly modern and cutting edge, at least much more so than I was expecting, sure some might see the cheesy chiptune and future bass influence as a bit off putting, but the way it's implemented is so joyfully quirky and instantly lovable I really can't see it as a distraction. I love the dynamics here as well, this albums leaps from one jittery sound to the next not unlike the Iglooghost album that came out this same year, but Tanaka totally puts his own twist on this style with off-kilter bleeps and loads of wacky synth textures.This is plainly some of the most vibrantly alive electronic music I have heard in a long ass time, and It's an utter crime that people somehow missed this.

yofriend
Sarah + 2 is Vaughan's second recording supported solely by a double bass and a guitar. The first one from the previous year (After Hours) was recorded in New York, this time, she recorded in L.A. with west coast musicians, Barney Kessel and Joe Comfort, who are both very much up to the occasion.The concept was slightly altered from the NYC recording, upbeat tunes were now included, but the level of musicianship was the same. Sarah renders every song her own. Her interpretations are strictly Jazz, however, her sensibility and her singing technique resemble the professional ethics of a classical recording.Sarah + 2 is the ideal place to study this exceptional singer. Once attuned to the intimacy of the music, the listener is likely to wonder how this high level of artistry is not recognized the way it should.The remastered CD from 2006 brings Sarah to the center of the living room.

Laura Mvula
Review by
leonardooo
British singer Laura Mvula’s third studio album is the best of her career. Bright and colorful songs explode in lust for sensuality as she also becomes a more aware person about herself and those around her.
Laura Mvula wanted her third album to be sexy. “I wanted it to be. I needed it to be,” she told Apple Music. For Mvula, her first two albums, 2013’s Sing to the Moon and 2016’s The Dreaming Room, grew out of a desire to take music seriously, but perhaps too seriously. “I had gotten so comfortable with everything being so focused on the music as its own thing, and somehow I was sort of separate from that. This time I wanted to be front and center,” she completed. Pink Noise is the result of that, the project where she allowed herself to “paint using more colors than perhaps I let myself use before.”Pink Noise is Mvula’s best album. It is a nostalgic journey into the brilliant and glorious past of the 1980s. With a precise and spaced production, unlike anything Laura has done so far, the album delivers one hit after another. They are brilliant and spontaneous songs that are born from Laura’s intriguing desire to have fun, however, she never gives up working on other subjects while dancing, crying, or thinking too much. They are also visual tracks that manage to show neon colors of pink and bright blue, or even Mvula on a bright stage singing a timeless R&B anthem. The most ironic thing is that nothing seems complicated or that it took a lot to reach this state of excellence. Pink Noise is an album that was born great. The production and sound of the album is his strongest point. The most amazing thing, however, is how the synthesizers, the strings, and the percussions are simple and very spaced as if they were far apart, but in the end, they magically come together to create this magical, brilliant, and very catchy sound. I think that’s clear in the first few seconds of the opener, “Safe Passage,” where she sings about leaving a bad past behind and moving on to a better place. In the beginning, strong synth beats appear and soon after are accompanied by Mvula’s voice. They both sound far apart but you can easily feel a chemical atmosphere between them. Over time, the track will get stronger, bright strings appear followed by choirs. However, nothing seems to get in front of the other, everything seems well-coordinated and acting independently to create this stunning opening song.And luckily, in no time the album lacks an amazing and impressive or, at least, danceable production. The title track, for example, features a reverberant bass, visual synthesizers, and homogeneous drums. In the chorus, confetti seems to fall to the ground. Mvula, accompanied by her band that also occasionally plays trombone, sings, “I know that you feel it/And you can’t deny it.” “What Matters,” a collaboration with Biffy Clyro’s Simon Neil, is a well-balanced duet. Neil completes Mvula perfectly as they sing about this conflicted love story. The funniest thing, however, is how Neil’s voice is treated with various effects, but it doesn’t sound detrimental or awkward at all. Finally, “Got Me” is the pure definition of R&B. It’s a banger.However, it’s not just the sound part that Laura delivers a full package. Her composition is also something that shines too. Again, the most curious thing is the simplicity. It doesn’t need long verses full of metaphors, but rather a few words to charm the listener with something that sounds purposefully raw but starkly honest. With differentiated strings, “Remedy” appears as a cry for help and indignation. She sings about the murders of black people and the protests that took over last year. “How many more must die?/Before the remedy,” she sings in the chorus and then adds, “You surround me with guns at every turn/See the system is rigged to shoot me first.” But more than ever, she looks at herself too. In “Church Girl” she asks herself, “How can you dance with the devil on your back?/How can you move?/Caught up in a picture-perfect/That will never last.” But, as a relief, the final track comes to say, “Remember the night comes before the dawn,” after she confesses, “All I wanted was to feel love/Something I never knew the meaning of.”However, the best song on the record is “Magical.” In a cheap pun, this track is simply magic. Mvula’s production goes insane here, her composition goes insane here, her flow, her rhythm, her look, and her vocals. It’s a grand, brilliant track that sounds like a timeless anthem that would easily become a landmark song for a whole generation of songwriters and producers. On the hook, when all the instruments come together, Laura appears on top of a stage performing a great show, Broadway-level. Everything is bright and colorful and she, with her soft, sweet vocals, seems to melt away as the track progresses. “Do you remember?/The time when we were together/It seemed like something was magic/Never imagined it would be over,” she sings. It’s not only the best song on the album, it’s also easily one of the best of the year.However, in a way, you still wish Mvula would loosen up even more than she did here. “Conditional,” for example, has a really good chorus but it feels a little disconnected from the rest of the track. “Golden Ashes,” meanwhile, despite having excellent vocal work, both Mvula and the backing vocals, and having this lyric about suffering and not letting yourself down, you still feel like it could have gone a little wilder on it. Even “What Matters,” perhaps, Neil could have had a more present role on the track than he did. “Magical,” on the other hand, could never have ended. Damn, this song is so fucking good.

Call Me If You Get Lost (2021)
Tyler, the Creator
Review by
LegendsWillNeverDie
Tyler at his best lyrically
Tyler, The Creator is a 30 year old rapper, singer, songwriter, producer, actor, visual artist, designer & comedian from Ladera Heights, California blowing up a decade ago as the de facto leader of Odd Future. His evolution both artistically & personally since the collective’s disbandment in 2015 has truly been amongst the most fascinating ones I’ve ever witnessed in my lifetime, going from the bratty edginess of Bastard & Goblin to the undeniable maturity & versatility shown on Flower Boy & Igor. I have a lot of fond memories of Tyler’s early work back in middle school/early high school, but I do think his last 2 albums are his best ones yet musically. That being said, I’ve been waiting all year for this day to come & I’m thrilled that it has.“Sir Baudliere” starts off by introducing us to the Tyler Baudliere character over a sample or “Michael Irvin” by Westside Gunn whereas “Corso” serves as an off-the-wall opener “talkin’ that fresh shit”. “Lemonhead” with 42 Dugg of all people has a grimy ass instrumental & the 2 are just flexing, but then “Wusyaname” with YoungBoy Never Broke Again samples “Back Seat (Wit No Sheets)” by H-Town & details falling in love with a woman they just met.Meanwhile on “Lumberjack”, Tyler takes it back to the “Yonkers” days with it’s boom bap production sampling the Gravediggaz just before he & Lil Wayne jump on a flute heavy beat for “Hot Wind Blows” to talk about landing in Geneva as well as reminiscing on leaving LA for the first time on the spacey “Massa”. Following this is the triumphant spending anthem “Runitup” & after that, Domo Genesis reunites with T on “Manifesto” saying people are fake mad on top of samples of both Jimmy Smith & Nas.“Sweet” starts off as a neo-soul cut telling this woman how much he loves her with the 2nd half “I Thought You Wanted to Dance” being a duet with Fana Hues that I almost wanna say goes into reggae territory. After the “Momma Talk” skit, DAISY comes in to picture to clap back at their non-believers on the glossy boom bap banger “Rise!” co-produced by Jamie xx leading into the “Blessed” interlude.The song “Juggernaut” with Lil Uzi Vert & Pharrell is a bombastic homage to the iconic Gucci Mane joint “Lemonade” while the penultimate track “Wilshire” works in some dusty drums & mellow synths speaking on a failed relationship he had with his homie’s girl for damn near 9 minutes. Finally, the closer “Safari” triumphantly speaks on his influence & impact on music featuring co-production from Jay Versace.Every album Tyler has ever put out sounds completely different than one another & Call Me If You Get Lost is a fine addition to his discography. He goes back into a more hip hop-based sound in comparison to the poppy vibes of IGOR, but it feels like a throwback to the Gangsta Grillz mixtape days with DJ Drama’s narrations & dude is at his best in terms of the bars on here.

MIKE
Review by
SlarkSlark
MIKE opts for an extremely nostalgic direction on his 7th album release, blending a heavy dose of hypnagogic pop and classic samples into his unique glitch hop mix. This album featured some of MIKE's most well crafted instrumentals yet, and an especially close attention to sound design. Vocally, MIKE is up to his old tricks, icy and downbeat bars which vary slightly in speed but are largely consistent in mood. This is a great time for anyone to get into MIKE, simultaneously his most accessible and his most definitive release. Best tracks: All of em!Score: 9.3

Hiatus Kaiyote
Review by

I tend to enjoy older music most of the time, so I don't usually find myself on the edge of my seat waiting for an album to drop.
After hearing the incredible creativity from Hiatus Kaiyote's first two albums, though, I was sure this one would be amazing too.
This album had me feeling more excited than any other album release so far, and the pay off was definitely worth it. Get Sun is the pivotal track on this album. Unlike their last, which was focused on complex electronic synth worth, Mood Valiant is a warm exploration through a tropical setting of birds and flowers.
Flight of the Tiger Lily immediately sets the mood by repurposing the strings from Get Sun, in a twisting, humid landscape.
The thing Hiatus Kaiyote does best is layers. Nai's vocals pile on top of each other, supported by unique, vintage synths that sound as if they are mimicking her unique tone of voice.
The sound design on Mood Valiant is extraordinary, somehow consolidating dozens of distinct sounds and instruments into gorgeous songs, all without devolving into noise. Mood Valiant showcases Hiatus Kaiyote at their most creative and emotional, and it feels like their most cohesive and inspired project to date.

A Hallowed Reunion
I’ve been a big fan of Power Metal ever since I started seeking out less mainstream Metal bands, so it’s always awkward having to say that I think Helloween are a bit overrated for me. Granted, it took me a while to get to them amidst all the Avantasia, Edguy, and Blind Guardian I was listening to back then. Hell, I didn’t even know that Michael Kiske and Kai Hansen played major roles in Avantasia’s “Wicked Trilogy” nor did I know that Helloween basically spearheaded the Power Metal movement in the mid-80’s with their self-titled EP before releasing The Walls of Jericho. It felt like their appeal had flown right past me by the time I finally checked out Keeper of the Seven Keys in full. Helloween were fast, raw, and exciting, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it all felt more than a bit dated compared to the rest of my favorite Power Metal acts despite its classic status. It isn’t a secret that Helloween’s quality took a nosedive in the 1990’s, resurfacing for brief gasps of air here and there with new vocalist Andi Deris taking the helm from Kiske. I’ve always had some issues with Kiske’s vocals, but Deris would really become an Achilles heel for me in regards to enjoying Helloween’s more modern content. However, I caught wind of a new self-titled album that promised a full reunion of the band and, upon seeing the painted cover art instead of the tacky 3D renderings, my interest was more than piqued.That’s a lot to promise, though, considering Helloween is nearing their 40th anniversary as a band. It takes a certain group of musicians and just being in the right place at the right time to recreate the energy needed to produce a fantastic record 30 years after the band’s so-called prime, especially in a genre like Power Metal. I’m glad to say they pulled it off though, since Helloween might be one of the best self-titled returns to form ever spawned. It’s not going to reinvent the Power Metal genre, nor does it necessarily need to, but I can safely say that this album has something for every kind of Power Metal fan, whether they want a classic Helloween experience or a more modern, more Heavy Metal inspired style. Most of the Heavy Metal inspiration comes with Deris’ modern Helloween songwriting, with him being cited as responsible for “Fear of the Fallen”, “Mass Pollution”, “Rise Without Chains”, “Cyanide”, and partially responsible for “Best Time”. Even though these tracks grew on me after a few listens, they feel so much more straightforward than something like “Angels” or “Robot King”, especially “Mass Pollution” with its blatant stadium-anthem portions that make my eyes roll a bit. They’re still higher quality than average, run-of-the-mill Power Metal tracks though, thanks to great harmonies supplied by the three Helloween vocalists and admittedly addictive choruses and riffs. Although I never cared much for Deris’ voice and delivery, his rawer energy pairs well with Kiske when they sing together for extended periods of time in tracks like “Angels”.In many ways, Helloween is a celebration of old meeting new and is far from a simple publicity stunt made to coast on the fact that Kiske and Hansen are listed in the credits. Kiske, Deris, and Hansen’s vocals intertwine and harmonize with one another in ways that feel fun and creative rather than just having them trade on and off, making this album feel like a real reunion rather than a fabricated one. Right from the start “Out for the Glory” has a very classic Power/Speed Metal with a fast, galloping drum beat behind Kiske’s more freeform vocal melodies which eventually leads to the big reveal of the multiple vocalists present on the album. Deris definitely steals the spotlight a bit more aggressively on his songs but it’s legitimately exciting to hear these two harmonize so well on “Fear of the Fallen” and especially “Skyfall”. The tradeoffs between the two are well written too, which admittedly appeals to me more than most since I’m such a huge Avantasia fan. Helloween does have shades of the metal opera that both Kiske and Hansen have been a part of in the past with its large emphasis on symphonic elements compared to Helloween’s old material. While Helloween may be a bit less shreddy and sadly has less bass presence, they cranked up the epic atmosphere with the help of a ton of choir and orchestration on “Out for the Glory”, “Angels”, and “Skyfall”, as well as a commonly used, heavenly atmosphere on certain choruses like “Robot King” and “Fear of the Fallen”. I can see why fans of 1980’s Helloween may shake their fists at this, but as someone who likes my Power Metal on the more epic side, this album is extremely well proportioned between having those epic elements and remaining sharp and exciting. Even though the album has some pretty generic Heavy Metal riffing on tracks like “Mass Pollution” and “Indestructible” I don’t necessarily find them boring and “Indestructible” has an especially cool solo section given the rest of the track is slightly forgettable. The more classic sounding Power Metal tracks are where the riffing really shines though, with “Out for the Glory” and “Skyfall” having more organic, shred oriented melodies with noticeably punchier bass volume.“Skyfall” is the easiest way to sell this album, though, since it’s probably the best thing that Helloween has released up to this point. I’ve never been partial to “Halloween” or “Keeper of the Seven Keys” even though I think they’re perfectly fine epics, but “Skyfall” is absolutely fantastic and earns every minute of its 12-minute runtime. So many different riffs are explored, taking the track through a variety of twists and turns through furious Speed Metal riffing, to stripped down storytelling sections, to choir-backed guitar solos all while Deris and Kiske put their own unique flair into their respective vocal sections.Even though I believe that Helloween is an incredibly solid album, I wouldn’t necessarily call it the savior of modern Power Metal or anything like that. While it’s exciting to hear Helloween return to some of their old songwriting tactics, the riffs and melodies aren’t the most engaging and some tracks could have used some more pop in places, especially during some of the transitions in “Cyanide”. That being said, this is a momentously fun album just to hear old and new Helloween collide head-on, which isn’t something you get to hear from bands too often. Despite parting with the band for assumedly various reasons in the past, these guys obviously still share some creative synergy that allowed them to do the unthinkable; they released a self-titled album that actually lives up to the promises of returning to a form that’s at least somewhat different than their modern material. Considering I can’t say I was a massive fan of modern or classic Helloween, this album is a huge win for the band on top of being immensely fun to listen to in general.

Review by
bloodzboi
在很久之前我和Pan Daijing演出过，她冷峻的目光和在其下的创造品一直让我望而生畏，那种敬畏感也让我对她三年前被很多人提到的上一张专辑没有太多共鸣，我总是给出太“黑”了太工业了这样的结论，但是这张的感受却是出乎意料的，不知道是否是“玉观音”的名字足够吸引我还是什么别的，我连着听了五遍，在那些穿插着她的声音的轰鸣声里呆了几个小时，“Is life worth living?“不停的在我脑子里转，“玉观音”呈现的是一种原始的恐惧，对孤独的恐惧，像Pan说的那样 “孤独就像你游过的一个巨大的湖。有时你把头伸进去，有时你把它抬起来。”，它充满了焦虑，模糊，和不确定，你被它折磨却还是一次次被勾住了魂魄，这种贴合着肌肤般的情感最终会吞噬你。

The Velvet Rope (1997)
Janet
Review by
Hurricanslash
An intensely perfect, crushingly beautiful, painfully earnest and melancholic album, The Velvet Rope has Janet explore herself, her troubles and her cares for the world in the most intricate detail while also basically dictating what R'n'B would sound like in the entire 00s. This album has been dissected to hell and back, how it effortlessly mixes genres in a way that shows their common ground, how it experiments with EDM/IDM influences to almost predict what Trap could sound like 10 years later, how Janet is at her most vulnerable and fractured on here, how the whole album is described with the opening words "Twisted Elegance", people know about this album. Still, it is absolutely unbelievable how fresh this album still sounds all these years later, how crisp and clean the production is and just how forward-thinking it was. This is perfect experimental Pop-music that never forgets to be extremely catchy yet daring at the same time. An artistic statement to be remembered by. The fourth for Janet at this point, and absolutely the most hard-hitting and jaw-dropping.

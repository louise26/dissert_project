Green and Amber list updates
Last updated: 05 August 2021, 12:00
Following the latest UK Government announcement, we’re busy working on what exactly this means for our flights departing from different parts of the UK. The good news is, even more destinations have been added to the UK Government’s Green and Amber Lists.
If your booking is affected in any way, we’ll be in touch with you soon. We kindly ask you to hold off from contacting us and wait for us to get in touch with more details as soon as we can. If you’re thinking of changing or cancelling your booking, take a look at our Traffic Light Update here and Changes and Refunds Policy
here.
Ahead of your flight, please visit our website regularly right up to just before you’re due to depart, when we’ll have all the latest travel requirements. Please note, if you’re fully vaccinated or under 18, the same UK entry requirements apply for Green and Amber List destinations. We’d recommend that you don’t start arranging things like COVID-19 tests until closer to your time of travel, as travel requirements both here and abroad can change.

*All prices one way including taxes. Just so you know, if you’re fully vaccinated, you can travel to Green and Amber List destinations and not self-isolate on return to the UK. But make sure you consider the age and vaccination status of everyone you're travelling with, as requirements vary. Please note, if you're not fully vaccinated and are happy to self-isolate, you’re still welcome to travel to Amber List destinations.

Employees of IONOS or another service provider may manually review the results of such checks in individual cases. The legal basis for data processing for the purpose of device fingerprinting is our legitimate interest as IONOS has a legitimate interest in protecting itself against fraud and/or misuse.For the purpose of fraud prevention, we process usage data such as IP addresses, information about the web pages accessed and information about the time and duration of such access.

We set a cookie so that we can recognise these IDs. The cookie contains a cookie ID but no personal usage or transaction data. This allows us to identify the device without knowing the person behind it by name or linking it to the device ID.In the event that the comparison described above is successful, i.e. fraud or attempted fraud has occurred from this device in the past, we will refuse to conclude the contract in that specific case.In order to optimise fraud prevention processes, your data will be transferred to ThreatMetrix (see below for information and contact details of the service provider/sub-service provider used) if you have given your consent.

Barclaycard’s trading address is at 1234 Pavilion Drive, Northampton NN4 7SG.  'You' means the person the information relates to.
This policy applies to information held about customers and possible future customers, suppliers and possible future suppliers, contacts and all other people we hold information about.  By ‘information’ we mean personal and financial information about you that we collect, use, share and store. For further details on the information about you that we may process, please see the full Barclaycard Privacy Policy PDF (339KB).
How we collect information about you
We collect, use, share and store information about you to provide you with the services that you have requested from us and to share information with you about services that may be of interest to you.  We will collect your information directly from you or from third parties.  For further details of where we may obtain your information from, see the full Barclaycard Privacy Policy PDF (339KB).
How we use your information
We use this information:
to provide our services to you;
to help us develop new and improved products and services to meet our customers' needs;
for security and to check your identity;
for training;
to communicate with you;
to comply with legal and regulatory obligations;
where we have a legitimate interest in doing so, such as the protection of our business interests or the prevention of fraud; and
to keep you informed about products and services you hold with us and to send you information about products or services (including those of other companies that may be of interest to you).
We will use automated processes. For further information, including the legal basis on which we use your information, please see the full Barclaycard Privacy Policy PDF (339KB).
Sharing your information with others
We’ll keep your information confidential but we may share it in certain circumstances, for the purposes set out in this policy, with:
other Barclays companies;
other companies who provide a service to you, for example if you use our products to make a purchase or payment;
any company we are providing services with or whose name or logo appears on our products;

We do this to assess creditworthiness and product suitability, check your identity, manage your account, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity. These agencies may in turn share your personal information with other organisations. If fraud is detected, you could be refused certain services, finance or employment.
If false or inaccurate information is provided to us and fraud is identified, details may be passed to credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering and to verify your identity.
The Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN) describes how the three main credit reference agencies in the UK each use and share personal data. The CRAIN is available on the credit reference agencies’ websites:
www.callcredit.co.uk/crain
www.equifax.co.uk/crain
www.experian.co.uk/crain

Cookie Policy
This website uses cookies and similar technologies to collect data from your device. Like many banks, we need to collect this data for the website to operate, but we also use it to provide the best experience, understand how you use our website, provide social media features, personalise content, deliver service messages and deliver adverts.
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information, which your computer or mobile device downloads when you visit a website. When you return to websites – or visit websites that use the same cookies – they recognise these cookies and therefore your browsing device.
We use cookies to do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience. They can also help ensure that ads you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. We also use similar technologies such as pixel tags and JavaScript to undertake these tasks.
If you visit our website, we will deploy these technologies to provide an online service more suited to the device you connect from, as well as to prevent and detect fraud, keeping you secure. When you visit our website from any device (mobile, tablet or PC), we collect information about your use of this site, such as information about the device or browser you use to access the site (including device type, operating system, screen resolution etc.), the way you interact with this site, and the IP address your device connects from. You may not be able to initiate or complete some activities within our secure online services unless these cookies or similar technologies are installed. Please note, we may not be able to process certain transactions if you are physically located in certain countries.
We use cookies to:
Ensure your security and privacy when in our secure sites
Store login details for our secure sites
Temporarily store input information in our calculators, tools, illustrations and demonstrations
Provide you with ads that are more relevant to you and your interests, and improve our targeting and enhance your journey through our sites and partner sites
Improve our understanding of how you navigate through our sites so we can identify improvements
Evaluate our sites' advertising and promotional effectiveness; and
We use both our own (first-party) and partner companies' (third-party) cookies to support these activities
The types of cookies used on this website fall into one of four categories - Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functionality & Profile and Targeting.
Strictly Necessary
The data collected in this category is essential to provide our services to you. The data is necessary for the website to operate, to verify your identity and to maintain your security and privacy while using the website. It enables you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. This category is always on, as without this data, the services you’ve asked for can’t be provided. Although it is possible to disable cookies on websites via the browser settings, this would affect the functionality of the website, causing it not to work. This data is not used for marketing purposes or for the purposes covered by the other three categories below.
Performance
In most cases, the data collected in this category is anonymous and is used to inform us how the website is used, for example which areas you use most often and if you receive any error messages. With this data we can then improve how our website works and be sure that the products and services we offer are right for you and other people.
In limited cases for mobile banking issues, the information also enables us to identify specific issues you may have had.
This data is not used to target you with online advertising. Without this data, we can't assess how our website is performing and make relevant improvements that could better your banking experience.
Functionality & Profile
Data collected in this category enables the website to remember choices you make. This means a more personalised experience for features of the website that can be customised. It may also be used to provide services you've asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog.
The data may also be used to ensure that our banking services and communications are relevant to you. This category can’t track your activity on other websites. Without this data, the website can’t remember choices you've previously made or personalise your experience in the website.
Targeting
Data collected in this category is used to help make our messages more relevant to you. The data informs us about how you use the website and is shared with other Barclays systems or third parties, such as advertisers and platforms we may use to deliver personalised messages. We do this in order to provide you with targeted advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests, and to improve how personalised messages work and help us identify issues.
If you don’t wish to consent to this category, it’s important to note that you may still receive generic advertising or service messages, but they will be less relevant to you and your interests. In addition, you will still be informed of important notifications about your account via other channels, such as SMS, mailings, email etc.
Cookies in emails
In addition to the cookies we use on this website, we also use cookies and similar technologies in some emails and push notifications. These help us to understand whether you have opened the email and how you have interacted with it. If you have enabled images, cookies may be set on your computer or mobile device. Cookies will also be set if you click on any link within the email.
Setting your data preferences
You can control how non-essential categories of cookies are placed on your device via the Data Preferences page.
Review preferences
What happens to data collected by cookies that have been downloaded in the past?
If you'd initially consented to one or more categories, we may still use the data collected at that time, when you had previously provided your consent.  When you change your settings to disable any of the non-essential categories, we will re-set our systems as soon as reasonably possible to stop using those categories to gather any further data.

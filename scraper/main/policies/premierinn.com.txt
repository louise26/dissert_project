Acceptable forms of identification are: a passport, driving licence, ID card or police warrant card. When checking in to our hotels in Germany, we must comply with the requirements of the German Federal Registration Act.Guests in Germany are requested to fill out a registration form and to indicate travel dates, names, birthdays, addresses, citizenship and the number of fellow travellers. For non-German guests, the number of a passport or other identity card is also required.

where you (or a person acting on your behalf) provide us with dietary or other personal health data such as allergies.
Other recipients that we disclose, transfer or share your personal data with.
Group companies
We will share your personal data with Whitbread Group plc and other companies in the Whitbread Group for administering hotel and restaurant services & products. Details of the Whitbread group can be found on our corporate website at www.whitbread.co.uk. The group includes inter alia Whitbread Group plc and Premier Inn Hotels Limited in the UK and Premier Inn Holdings GmbH and its subsidiaries in Germany. Premier Inn shares data within the Whitbread group when Whitbread Group plc provide us with support, advisory, IT, safety and security, including CCTV, and other services.
Premier Inn Hotels Ltd is the representative of Premier Inn (Isle of Man) Ltd and Premier Inn (Jersey) Ltd in the EU.
Service Providers
For some activities Premier Inn uses third party service providers including where we are joint controllers. Your personal data will be disclosed to such organisations where this is necessary to provide a service to you, or where it is in our legitimate interests. You will be informed separately if a third party is operating as a joint controller with Premier Inn. Third parties are used to:
administer bookings;
provide Wi-Fi;
provide parking facilities (e.g. for Sleep Park Fly);
undertake customer feedback surveys;
provide analytics;
send promotional offers;
provide personalised advertisements;
provide insurance;
provide IT development, support, maintenance and hosting, including the provision of applications and website hosting;
process payments to enable you to pay by credit or debit card;
provide credit checks and fraud checks; and
provide CCTV systems and maintenance.
Other parties
Personal data may be shared with regulators, government authorities and/or law enforcement officials for the prevention or detection of crime, if required by law or if required for a legal or contractual claim or regulatory purposes.
We disclose your personal data to payment providers, technology providers, insurers, and other specialist professional and technical advisers, to manage your bookings, arrange payments, and provide services.
With your consent, we will also disclose your personal data to Ombudsman services and Citizens’ Advice.
A very small number of hotels using the Premier Inn brand are run by a franchisee partner Greene King Brewing and Retailing Limited. Your data will be shared with such franchisee where you book one of those hotels to enable them to fulfil your booking and any related services requested by you. Such franchisee is committed to protecting your privacy but, to be clear, the franchisee is an independent business and is responsible for the operation of its own hotels and compliance with data protection laws.
Restructure and sale
We may restructure our internal group of companies so that different group companies run our hotels and related services. So, for example, in the future Whitbread Group plc (or another group company) may take over responsibility for the running and operation of hotels from Premier Inn Hotels Ltd. If this happens we will let you know and your data may be shared with such company and processed as set out in this notice.
In the event that the business is sold or integrated with another business, your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s adviser and will be passed to the new owners of the business.
International transfers
Sometimes we may need to send or store your data outside of the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway) (‘EEA’). For example, to follow your instructions, comply with a legal duty or to work with or receive services from our service providers who we use to help run your accounts and our services.
If we do transfer information outside of the EEA, we will make sure that it is protected by using one of these safeguards:
Transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA. Some countries have been deemed adequate by the EU.
Put in place a contract with the recipient that means they must protect it to the same standards as the EEA or use other mechanisms and measures to achieve adequate protection. We also may use the Standard Contractual Clauses published by the EU.
Transfer it to organisations that are part of Privacy Shield. This is a framework that sets privacy standards for data sent between EU countries and the US. It makes sure those standards are similar to what is used within the EEA.
Binding corporate rules. These are internal rules adopted by group companies to allow international transfers of personal data to entities within the same corporate group located in countries which do not provide an adequate level of protection.
For some of our service providers in the US, we rely on Privacy Shield. For example the party who helps us with our customer feedback surveys. We rely on contractual measures for a small number of our suppliers who have or use offices outside the EEA and who have restricted access to some data to provide us with IT services including development, testing, support and maintenance. For further details on the mechanisms used and for a copy of the chosen safeguards please contact privacyofficer@whitbread.com
Business Account
If you apply for a Business Account a separate Privacy Notice will also apply. Further information is available by clicking here.
Significant automated decision-making
Like many businesses we use business rules on financial and other information in order to detect and prevent fraud. When used, these may identify a risk and, as a result, a particular transaction may not be processed.
What rights do I have?
Withdrawing consent
Wherever we rely on your consent, you will always and at any time be able to withdraw that consent with effect for the future. We will continue to process your personal data for other purposes on a different lawful basis (other than consent) where that applies.

In such case, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights and freedoms or that the processing serves the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, and any profiling we carry out for direct marketing, at any time and without any limitation. You can do this by clicking on the 'unsubscribe' link located in the footer of every marketing email or text or by contacting us (see the contact details provided below). Where you objected to our processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process your personal data for such purposes.
Where you have a relationship with another organisation, such as a social media platform like Facebook, we may ask them to send marketing to you, subject to your consent. If you object to receiving marketing from us we will stop marketing to you. However, please contact the organisation directly if you want to withdraw your consent to such organisation marketing to you.

You have the right to know whether or not we process information about you and to access that information.
You have the right to update, correct and complete any information we hold about you which is inaccurate or incomplete.
You have the right to obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a commonly used, structured, and machine-readable format, and to ask us to share (port) this personal data to another controller.
You have the right to ask that we erase or restrict (stop active) processing of your personal data.
These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person or you ask us to erase information which we are required by law to Relevant exemptions are also included within the data protection laws that apply in the UK or Germany as the case may be. We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.
To exercise any of these rights, you can get in touch with us using the details set out below.

How long will you retain my personal data?
We keep your data to enable us to fulfil our contract with you or to provide services, where required by law, to respond to a question or complaint, to obey rules about keeping records, to uphold or protect contractual or legal rights or where it is in your or another party’s vital interests or our legitimate interests.

We also keep your data in line with any statutory limitation periods and for tax, legal or regulatory purposes.
The period for which we will retain your personal data depends on the purposes for which we are processing it and where the same personal data is processed for two or more purposes, we will retain it for the longest period. For example, we retain:
CCTV recording for up to 31 days in the United Kingdom and 48 hours in Germany;
for up to 1 year incoming and outgoing voice recordings (although we will keep a record of any consent you give us during a call for as long as we rely on it as the lawful basis for processing);
for up to 25 months from your last stay, any personal data we process for managing your hotel or restaurant bookings;
for up to 36 months after it is resolved, any personal data we process in relation to queries, complaints or feedback relating to your hotel or restaurant booking;
until a period of 3 years has elapsed since your last interaction with us, personal data we process for marketing (including profiling) purposes, unless you ask us to stop sending electronic direct marketing, in which case we will act on your request, and then keep a record of your request indefinitely;
for 3 years in the case of accident report forms (or for accidents relating to a child, for 3 years after the child’s 18th birthday);
for up to 6 years from your last stay or access to your account, any personal data in an account you have set up with us, for example a My Premier Inn Account or Business Booker Account;
for up to 6 years in the UK and upto 10 years in Germany, financial and transactional data for the purposes of insights and analytics; and
for up to 7 years in the UK and upto 10 years in Germany, financial information for accounting, business reporting, analysis and audit purposes.
In any of the cases mentioned above, we may retain the personal data for longer, if it is required for the purposes of any internal or external investigation or litigation. In these cases, it may be retained until the matter is resolved. We may keep your data for longer in line with any limitation periods, or if we cannot delete it, e.g. for tax, legal or regulatory reasons.
You have the qualified right to request deletion of your personal data at any time, or we may choose or be obliged to erase your personal data earlier, for example, if we no longer need to process it.

Access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.)
Web browser and operating system used
complete IP address of the requesting computer

The extension generates passes containing cryptographically "blinded" tokens that are signed by the web server when a challenge page is solved. These tokens are "unblinded" and stored by the extension for future use; they are redeemed automatically when a future challenge page is seen. The "blinding" procedure means that signed and redeemed tokens are cryptographically unlinkable from the server perspective and, as such, are suitable for usage in conjunction with external privacy measures (such as VPNs).Expand to Read moreThere are no ratings yetThere are no ratings yetThere are no ratings yetThere are no ratings yetRate your experienceHow are you enjoying Privacy Pass?Log in to rate this extensionThere are no ratings yetStar rating savedReport this add-on for abuseReport this add-on for abuseIf you think this add-on violates Mozilla's add-on policies or has security or privacy issues, please report these issues to Mozilla using this form.Please don't use this form to report bugs or request add-on features; this report will be sent to Mozilla and not to the add-on developer.DismissSend abuse reportRead all 550 reviewsPermissionsLearn moreThis add-on needs to:Access browser activity during navigationAccess your data for all websitesMore informationAdd-on LinksHomepageSupport siteSupport EmailVersion2.0.9Size237.52 KBLast updated9 days ago (Jul 12, 2021)LicenseBSD LicenseVersion HistorySee all versionsAdd to collectionSelect a collection…Create new collectionGo to Mozilla's homepageAdd-onsAboutFirefox Add-on ReviewsExtension WorkshopDeveloper HubDeveloper PoliciesCommunity BlogForumReport a bugReview GuideSite StatusBrowsersDesktopMobileRealityEnterpriseProductsLockwiseMonitorBrowsersPocketTwitter (@firefox)Instagram (Firefox)YouTube (firefoxchannel)PrivacyCookiesLegalExcept where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License v3.0 or any later version.Change languageAfrikaansعربيAsturianuAzərbaycancaБългарскиবাংলাBosanskiCatalàMaya KaqchikelČeštinaDanskDeutschDolnoserbšćinaΕλληνικάEnglish (Canadian)English (British)English (US)EspañolEesti keelEuskaraفارسیsuomiFrançaisFryskGaeilgeעבריתHrvatskiHornjoserbscemagyarInterlinguaBahasa IndonesiaItaliano日本語ქართულიTaqbaylit한국어lietuvių kalbaLatviešuМакедонскиМонголMelayuMaltiNorsk bokmålNederlandsNorsk nynorskਪੰਜਾਬੀ (ਭਾਰਤ)PolskiPortuguês (do Brasil)Português (Europeu)RomânăРусскийslovenčinaSlovenščinaShqipSvenskaతెలుగుไทยTürkçeУкраїнськаاُردوTiếng Việt中文 (简体)正體中文 (繁體)

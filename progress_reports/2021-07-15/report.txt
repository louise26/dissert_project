Progress report for period 2021-06-25 to 2021-07-08: 

Activity last week: 
- Made the scraper more robust to avoid errors and get some data.
- Found some heuristics to look for in script. 
- Extract 10 html websites which I manually reviewed. 
- Inspected the htmls and found some heuristics and identified sections and topics. 

  

Goals for next week:
- Write BeautifulSoup script to find heuristics with regular expressions.
- Try scraper on bigger list of websites (Alexa top 500 UK) and make the scraper more sophisticated. 
- Go further in understanding use of "necessary" to mean "legitimate interests"
- Try scraper on french websites? (Alex Top 50 French websites)

Questions for Tristan:
- What is the interim demos? What am I supposed to submit? Will I need to present something? 
- Should I aim at making the scraper more sophisticated for UK websites now, or try to expand it to French websites? 
- Not sure how to scale my manual review to hundreds of site. I will probably find out when I start playing with BeautifulSoup. What if I can't find anything. 
- What is my MVP?

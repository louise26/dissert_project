Progress report for period 2021-06-17 to 2021-06-24: 

Activity this week:
- Continued course on scrapy and tried to apply it to Trainline website
- Learnt about Selenium, gave up on Scrapy and decided to read more about Selenium
- Built scraper for Trainline with Selenium: starting from the website link, I managed to find the privacy button, get the link of the privacy page and access it. Then I managed to parse the data from the page, and save the text in a file. 
- Kept working on literature review (still need to finish it)

Goals for next week:
- Clean code with functions and no 'magic variables'
- Get the scraper to work on 50+ webistes (getting the links from a csv file)
- Find a database with more websites and make sure the scraper works on these too. 
- Start learning about topic modelling 

Questions for Tristan: 
- Which websites should I focus on when extending the use of my scraper? 
- Is it ok to get the websites' links from a database file? 
- When explaining how I built the scraper in my report, in which level of depth should I go? Should I explain why I chose Selenium rather than Scrapy?

Activity this week:

- Update table of contents 
- Add focus points for each part 

Goals for next week: 
- WRITE 

Questions for Tristan: 
- One of my primary objectives states that I'm going to build a scraper for UK-retail websites. Can I change this to UK Top 500 websites? Am I supposed to write exactly the same objective as the ones I wrote in my DOER? 
- How should I come up with a title? 
- Can we have a look at my Table of Contents? Do the titles and organisation make sense? 
- How would you describe Design/Implementation/Evaluation? 
- In which part should I explain error handling? 
- Can we have a look at my bullet points for 3.2.1 - Design of Web Scraper?

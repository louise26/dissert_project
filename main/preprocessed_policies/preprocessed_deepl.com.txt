Texts and Translations — DeepL translator (free version)  When using our translation service, please only enter texts that you wish to transfer to our servers.  The transmission of these texts is necessary in order for us to provide the translation and offer you our service.  We process your texts, the documents you upload and their translations for a limited period of time to train and improve  our neural networks and translation algorithms.  If you make corrections to our proposed translations, these corrections are also forwarded to our servers to verify  the accuracy of the corrections and, if necessary, to update the translated text to reflect your changes.  We also store your corrections for a limited period of time to train and improve our translation algorithm.  Please note that using our translation service for texts containing personal data of any kind is not allowed.  4. Texts and Translations — DeepL Pro  When using DeepL Pro, the texts or documents you submit will not be permanently stored and will only be kept temporarily,  to the extent necessary for the production and transmission of the translation.  Once you have received the translation, all submitted texts or documents and their translations will be deleted.  When using DeepL Pro, your texts will not be used to improve the quality of our services.  For further information, please see our DeepL Pro Terms and Conditions.  Please note that using DeepL Pro for texts that contain personal data of any kind is only permitted if you have concluded a  data processing agreement with us (see section 8.1.3 of DeepL Pro Terms and Conditions).  5. Automatic Collection of Data via Website Access  When you access our website www.deepl.com, for technical reasons your device will automatically transmit certain data.

Diagnostic information in the event of errors.  Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR based on our legitimate interest  in improving the stability and functionality of our website.  The data is stored for purely technical reasons and is not associated with a specific person.  Website access data is used for error analysis, ensuring system security, logging access to paid  services (e.g. DeepL Pro) and to improve our translation service.  Based on your IP address, we also use geolocation to determine the region from which you are visiting our website.  We use this information to check whether we can offer you the DeepL Pro service in your region,  which corresponds to our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.  The storage of the full IP address for a maximum period of 14 is also justified by our legitimate interest in  achieving the listed purposes, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence. 1 lit. f) GDPR.  6.

This information is processed in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR based on our legitimate  interest in improving the functionality of our products, as this makes it easier to identify any sources of error  related to the translation process.  The data is stored in a database that can only be accessed by selected employees and is automatically deleted after 14 days.  There is no storage of the submitted documents or their translations in this context.  7.

Registration and login at DeepL  In order to sign up for and subsequently use your DeepL Pro subscription, you will need to register and create an account at DeepL.  To ensure that you can log in, the following personal data will be stored:  E-mail address Password IP address  If your company uses Single Sign-On (SSO) to log in to DeepL, there is no need for a separate registration.  When you log in via Single Sign-On your company transmits your e-mail address as well as your first and last name directly to us.  8.2. Signing up for DeepL Pro  If you take out a DeepL Pro subscription after registering, the following personal data will also be collected and processed for  the purposes of concluding and fulfilling the contract and preparing invoices:  First name, surname, and where applicable, company name Address Payment details Tax numbers (where applicable) Selected subscription option possibly other, additional data you provided during the registration process.  In order to process payments, we forward the necessary payment data to our authorized payment service provider  Stripe Payments Europe Ltd, Block 4, Harcourt Centre, Harcourt Road, Dublin 2, Ireland.  Where necessary, Stripe will also transfer the data to Stripe, Inc., located in the USA.  Further information on Stripe's data protection and compliance with the requirements of Art. 44 GDPR  (particularly after the EU-US Privacy Shield has been declared invalid) can be found here.  We have concluded a data processing agreement with Stripe, which allows Stripe to process the data solely in  accordance with our instructions and not for its own purposes.  We process the data specified in 8.1. and 8.2. in order to initiate or fulfil a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.  The processing and storage of the data specified above is necessary for the conclusion of the contract as well as its fulfillment.  If an order is placed, we will store the data for the duration of the contract period and subsequently, if necessary, for the duration of statutory retention periods.  If, following registration, no order is placed, we will store your data for one month, following which it will be deleted.  In addition to the translation service on our website, we also offer apps for Windows and macOS operating systems, as well as a mobile app for iOS, through which you can also translate texts.  9.1. DeepL Windows and macOS Apps  The Windows and macOS apps use the same interfaces for creating translations as the web-based service.  Therefore, sections 3, 4, 6, and 7 of this privacy policy also apply to the use of the Apps.  When translating texts with the Windows or macOS app, for technical reasons your device will automatically transmit certain data.  The following data is stored separately from all other data you may transmit to us:  Date and time of access Version of the App Operating system Volume of data transmitted Notification of successful data retrieval Abbreviated/anonymised IP Full IP address (for a maximum duration of 14 days) Diagnostic information in the event of errors.  The processing of this data is based on our legitimate interest in ensuring and improving the stability and functionality of our services,  Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.  This data is stored solely for technical reasons and is not linked to a specific person.  Data relating to access is used for error analysis, ensuring system security, logging access to paid  services (e.g. DeepL Pro), and to improve our translation service.  Due to a legitimate interest in achieving the listed purposes, the full IP address will be stored for a short period of time,  You can use the Windows and macOS app in both the free version and the paid Pro version.  Section 3 of this privacy policy therefore also applies to the use of the apps in the free version.  If you use the Windows and macOS app while logged into your DeepL Pro account, the texts you submit will not be stored permanently and will only  be kept temporarily to the extent necessary for the creation and transmission of the translation.  Once you have received the translation, both the submitted texts or documents and their translations will be deleted (see also section 4).  We use cookies and web storage objects in our Apps for Windows and macOS.  Further information on can be found in section 7.  Due to technical reasons, the use of cookies and web storage objects in our apps cannot be deactivated.  If you do not (or no longer) agree with their use in the app, you can delete the app and instead use the web-based service where  you can manage these settings.  Your texts will be sent to DeepL for translation.  This, however, only takes place when you explicitly request a translation in the App.  This data is processed for the purpose of fulfilling the contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.  We offer the DeepL iOS app as a mobile app that you can download to your mobile device.  The iOS app is only available in the free version of DeepL. Section 3 of this privacy policy therefore also applies to the use of this app.  When you download our app from the Apple App Store, Apple collects, among other things, your hardware ID, your device's IP address, and your Apple ID.  We have no influence on the collection of this data, therefore Apple's data protection conditions will apply, which can be accessed here.  When using the DeepL iOS app, we automatically collect the following data, all of which is technically necessary to provide you with all the functions of our app and to ensure its stability and security:  Date and time of access Version of the App Operating system Volume of data transmitted Notification of successful data retrieval Abbreviated/anonymized IP address Full IP address (for a maximum duration of 14 days) Diagnostic information in the event of errors. Type of mobile device Language in use Time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) Access status/HTTP status code  This data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in ensuring the stability and functionality of our app, the security of our systems,  and error analysis in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.  This data is stored for purely technical reasons and is not associated with a specific person.  The full IP address is stored for the legitimate interest of achieving the listed purposes for a maximum period of 14 days.  No cookies are used in the iOS app. A unique user ID (no cross-device ID) however, is used, which allows us to track, for example, the source and target language settings,  how many characters are translated, whether the copy button is used, and if so, how it is used.  The processing of this data is based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR) to better understand the needs of our users and to be able to  adapt the app according to customer requirements.  In addition to the paid DeepL Pro API, we also offer a limited free version of our API (DeepL Free API).  For further information, please see our DeepL Pro Terms and Conditions and section 3 (see above) on using  the free version of DeepL.  In order to use the DeepL Free API, it is necessary to register with DeepL and create an account.  For this purpose, your data will be processed in accordance with section 8.1, i.e., your e-mail address, the password you chose, and your IP address will be stored.  If you book the Free API option during the checkout process, further data, as specified in section 8.2, will be collected.  Although no costs are incurred when using the DeepL Free API - subject to a (possible) upgrade - your payment data is collected in order to prevent improper use of the Free API.  Solely for this purpose, payment information is also passed on, in accordance with section 8.2., to the payment service provider we have commissioned, Stripe Payments Europe Ltd.  We process the data mentioned in sections 8.1. and 8.2. as part of the initiation or fulfillment  of the free-of-charge usage contract concluded between you and us on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.  If no order is placed following registration, we will store your data for one month and then delete it.  11. Contacting with our Sales or Support Team  We offer you the possibility to contact our Sales or Support team via a form provided on the website or by e-mail.  A valid e-mail address and your name are required so that we know who the enquiry comes from and can respond to it.  Your telephone number and the company name can be provided voluntarily.  If your request is related to the conclusion of a contract with us or concerns questions about the implementation of your contract  (in particular, Support requests), Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of your personal data,  including any subsequent correspondence. Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 GDPR also provides justification for the processing of personal data  that may be contained in documents sent to our Support team.  We will store your data for the duration of our business relationship and subsequently for the duration of the legal retention periods.  If you have contacted our Support team via the contact form, it is possible that we will subsequently inquire by e-mail about your satisfaction with our customer service.  In this case, we will process your data on the basis of our legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR in order to determine customer satisfaction and to continuously improve our service.  We use the ticket system of the provider Zendesk Inc. for the processing of your enquiries and the satisfaction survey.  (“Zendesk”), 1019 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA.  This may also involve the transfer of your data to the USA.

Blizzard Removes Diablo II Resurrected TCP/IP Multiplayer Support  Blizzard has silently removed TCP/IP multiplayer support in Diablo II Resurrected, going against its promise earlier that it will be a core feature in the remaster.  TCP/IP support will not be available in the upcoming Beta or the final game. After careful deliberation, we will no longer be supporting this option as we identified potential security risks and are committed to safeguarding the player experience.  Diablo II: Resurrected Act I & II Remastered Cinematics  Blizzard has released remastered cinematics of Act I and Act II for the upcoming Diablo II Resurrected.  Patch 9.1 Hotfixes - August 11, 2021  Published on 2021-08-11 10:32 PM  Patch 9.1 Hotfixes - August 11, 2021  Death's Advance, The Archivists' Codex, Ve'nari, and The Avowed reputations should now count towards the Exalted Reputation achievements.  Developers’ note: Some players who have already capped out their reputation with these factions may not see these update until next week’s restarts. We have a code change coming with restarts that will fix those players, but we want to get the data updated to prevent new players from running into the issue.  Fixed an issue where Decaying Soul Satchel and Wrath of Consumption Runecarving effects would persist after the items were removed.  The Loom of Fates should more easily maintain counterclockwise rotation without interruption.  Repulsive Visage will no longer be cast when Droman Oulfarran is at 25% HP or less.  Developers’ note: Currently it's possible to get Oulfarran to 20% just as Maloch begins casting Repulsive Visage, and this can feel frustrating and difficult to control when it happens. The goal of this change is to give players a small buffer so they can play around this ability more reliably.  Fixed an issue in the "The Power of Elune" quest where Shandris Feathermoon would sometimes use Sentinel's Ward at improper times.  Activision Blizzard Shareholder SOC Letter, Diablo II: Resurrected Early Access  Published on 2021-08-11 03:46 AM  Activision Blizzard Shareholder SOC Letter  Today, one of Activision Blizzard's shareholders has released a letter that criticizes the company's response to the recent lawsuit and the promises to improve its work culture.  In this letter, the SOC Executive Director has shared a list of changes for Activision Blizzard to make, including increasing board diversity and equity by adding a woman director, removing bonuses from executives found to have engaged in or enabled abusive behavior, and undertaking a company-wide Equity Review.  While we appreciate the improved tone and increased detail in CEO Kotick’s recent letter to Activision Blizzard employees, customers, and shareholders, the changes Mr. Kotick has announced do not go nearly far enough to address the deep and widespread issues with equity, inclusion, and human capital management at the company. To wit:  No changes have been announced or proposed that would in any way alter the current process for filling vacancies either to the board of directors or to senior management.No changes have been announced with respect to executive pay, either with respect to clawing back compensation from executives who are found to have engaged in or enabled abusive practices, or to align executives with the equity goals Mr. Kotick articulated.The announced review by Wilmer Hale is deficient in a number of ways: this firm has a sterling reputation as a defender of the wealthy and connected, but it has no track record of uncovering wrongdoing, the lead investigator does not have in-depth experience investigating workplace harassment and abuse, and the scope of the investigation fails to address the full range of equity issues Mr. Kotick acknowledges.  We believe that to ensure smooth operations and a strong reputation going forward, Activision Blizzard should commit to the following changes:  Increase board diversity and equity by adding a woman director – preferably one with a history of advocacy for marginalized people and communities - by the end of 2021, committing to gender-balance on the board by 2025, and reserving at least one board seat for a nominee selected by current employees as their representative.Claw back bonuses from executives found to have engaged in or enabled abusive behavior, award no bonuses for 2021, and make future bonus awards contingent on the company as a whole achieving clearly articulated and independently verified milestones for diversity and equity.Undertake a company-wide Equity Review, similar to the Racial Equity Reviews that Facebook, Air B&B, Starbucks, and BlackRock have completed or promised, but that will encompass the full range of concerns (including inequities rooted in gender, gender-identity, sexuality, and race) articulated by Mr. Kotick, Activision Blizzard employees, and customers: equity and representation issues in game design, the development process, and in user forums and similar settings.  Diablo II: Resurrected Early Access  Blizzard has announced the Early Access and Open Beta dates for Diablo II: Resurrected. Early Access testing will begin on August 13th, and the Open Beta weekend will begin on August 20th.  The upcoming test weekends will feature two additional classes for players to experience: the Druid and the Paladin. Classes from the last alpha test (the Sorceress, the Barbarian, and the Amazon) will also be available for testing.Multiplayer will be enabled alongside cross-progression on Windows® PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation®5 and PlayStation®4.Like in the Technical Alpha, both Act I: The Sightless Eye and Act II: The Secret of the Vizjerei will be fully playable. The fully remade Act I & II cinematics will also be viewable in the Diablo II: Resurrected Early Access and Open Beta tests.  Patch 9.1 Hotfixes - August 10, 2021  Published on 2021-08-11 01:58 AM  Patch 9.1 Hotfixes - August 10, 2021  (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)  A new set of grapple points were added to connect the southwest part of the Seeker's Quorum to the Vault of Secrets island to the south.  Developers’ note: This is available once your character has completed Chapter 3 in Korthia and should allow players close to the Vault to get across without having to go back to town and take the flayedwing flight.  The Tormentors of Torghast will now arrive at their destination in the Maw 5 minutes after the event announcement is broadcast.  Enemies in Comp Stomp are now stronger.  Fixed an issue where the quest “Tazavesh: A Hard Bargain” could not be turned in if the instance was allowed to reset after completing Myza's Oasis.Thrall and Jaina are now available to turn in “Doorway in the Dark” after the cutscene completes.  Patch 9.1 - Main Campaign Final Chapter Cutscene  Published on 2021-08-10 06:14 PM  Patch 9.1 - Main Campaign Final Chapter Cutscene  The final chapter of the Chains of Domination main campaign unlocked today. Currently, there is a bug causing the quest giver to despawn before turning in the first part of the chapter, but thanks to LeystTV, we have the cutscene that you will experience as you go through it.

Changes in your eyesight are usually very gradual, so regular eye tests are important. The recommendation is to have your eyes tested every two years, unless your optician prescribes otherwise. We'll send you a reminder shortly before the end of the recommended recall period, and follow up if we don't hear from you  To send you eye health communication regarding eye health and vision correction and how you can look after this. eg it's essential for your vision that glasses are fitted correctly, so we'll remind you to get your glasses checked and adjusted  To send you direct marketing communications - with your consent we'll send you information about our products, offers and discounts by email and/or post. Of course you are free to opt out of these communications at any time by updating your consent preferences. For details see our - How do you contact us or request a change section  Survey and feedback requests to help us improve our service to you and make our services and products more relevant to you.

To process any transactions when you purchase our goods and services  To process your credit/ debit card information when used to pay for our goods and services and dealing with refunds.

So we can respond to complaints, queries and any claims made against us.  To meet our contractual obligations  To recognise you as being a customer  Health and safety of members of the public, our staff and our customers  Corporate requirements including mergers and acquisitions.  Explaining the lawful basis for processingThere are a number of reasons that as a company we will collect and process your personal data, the lawful basis for processing your personal data we use are:  As a firm of registered Opticians, we are permitted by law to process special categories of personal data (e.g. data concerning your health).  The provision of eye health services in the UK is regulated by the Opticians Act and the Rules issued by the General Optical Council. In Ireland it is regulated by the Health and Social Care Professional Act and the Optical Registration Board Bye-laws. They legally require us to collect and process your personal data including special categories of your data (eg data concerning your health).  These laws regulate the type of information we can process when performing certain services eg conducting an eye examination, fitting contact lenses or prescription glasses. They also require us to provide information to regulators when they're investigating complaints or claims and to customers or third parties who make a subject access request.  Sometimes the purchase of a product or use of our services means you need to enter into a contract with us, where it's necessary for us to process your personal data.  For example - if you order a product in store, or via our online services or you join our contact lens Direct Debit scheme, we'll process the personal data you give us to ensure we deliver the correct product to your selected address, or to collect the Direct Debit payment from you.  We may also need to process your data for insurance purposes or to fulfil our contractual obligations with the NHS, or other third parties who we've contracted with.  As part of these obligations, we're required to process your personal data to a suitable standard of quality and accuracy, to provide information to third parties and other industry bodies, and to retain your personal data for set minimum periods of time.  For example, Our NHS Optical contract defines that we have to keep up to date and accurate patient and medical records and provide details of any NHS funded eye tests or purchases to the NHS.  Our legitimate interests are derived from our role as provider of eye health services to our customers, to protect and grow our business, commercial and financial interests, as well as our desire to retain existing and attract new customers.  We also rely on legitimate interests to make sure we let you know about our products and services, for sending you eye test reminders, sending you direct marketing communications and advertising, processing and reporting financial transactions, instituting and defending legal claims, market research, safety and security, statistical analysis and complaints.  For example - after your eye test, your optometrist will recommend the date of your next eye test. To help you look after your eye health, we will send you reminders by post or email when your next eye test is due.  In specific situations, we collect and process your data with your consent. We believe consent must be informed, specific and voluntarily given. We may require (written and/or verbal) consent from you in order to process your personal data for specific and limited reasons:  Providing your data to a third party who do not have a legal right to receive the information; including another optometrist, General Practitioners, hospitals or lawyers.  Providing your data to a third person, including another family member.  Consent from a child to provide personal data to a parent, where the child has been deemed capable of giving consent.  Where you have previously consented to the processing of your personal data for a specific reason, you are permitted to withdraw your consent at any time.  Please see our "How to contact us or change consent" section for more information.  5. Protecting the vital interests of data subject  As we collect information regarding your eye health, in exceptional circumstances we may be required to provide this information to another healthcare provider for your safety and to prevent significant harm.  For example - in exceptional circumstances we may provide information regarding your eye health to your hospital if you were unable to give us consent.  How long do we keep data?Whenever we collect or process data, we keep it for as long as is required by law, or for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfil the purpose it was originally collected for. We also keep records to satisfy industry body requirements, as well as to protect and defend ourselves against any claims.  As a registered provider of optical services, we're required to consider the General Optical Council (GOC) guidelines about contacting our customers for essential eye health check ups and the length of time we must keep customer records.  At the end of the retention period, we will either delete your data completely, anonymise it (for example by consolidating with other data so it can be used for statistical analysis and business planning) or put it beyond use.Who do we share your personal data with?We do share your personal data within our group of companies and with trusted third parties as an essential part of being able to provide our services to you. Please be assured we do not sell personal data, and do not provide personal data to list providers for the purposes of marketing.  Examples of third parties we work with to be able to provide our services to you, on our behalf include:  Operational companies such as delivery couriers who may deliver products or deliver communication to you on our behalf.  Product suppliers who make or provide the products we sell to you.  Third parties who we use to help us update your contact information to keep your data accurate.  IT and data companies who help support our websites and other business systems.  Other medical professionals including other optometrists, doctors or the NHS and third parties appointed by the NHS.  Public bodies who have the legal right to have access to the information e.g. the police.  Transfer of personal data to third-party countries.  From time to time we may share anonymised data with our third parties for analytical purposes.  Your personal information may be transferred to companies situated outside of the UK or the European Economic Area (EEA). In these instances, we have put additional safeguards, including contracts, in place as required by data protection laws.  If required, your data will be transferred securely, in line with the requirements of the relevant data protection authorities.  Subject access requests by third partiesVision Express will not provide personal data to third parties unless we have consent of the individual or we have a legal obligation eg to law enforcement.  If you've authorised a third party to submit a request for the release of your personal data, then we'll ask them for written proof of your consent or to provide a verifiable power of attorney.  Consent / power of attorney must:  Provide your name, address and date of birth  Provide details of the personal data to be disclosed  Provide details of the recipient, including contact details and confirmation of identity  Be signed and dated by you.  Authorities requiring data under exemptions may request personal data without your consent.

If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other aspect of Slack’s business.This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the Slack platform (‘Third-Party Services’), or any other third-party products, services or businesses. In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the ‘Customer Agreement’), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, ‘Customer Data’). The organisation (e.g. your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (the ‘Customer’) controls its instance of the Services (its ‘Workspace’) and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use. If you have an account, you can check http://slack.com/account/team for the contact information of your Workspace owner(s) and administrator(s). If you have received an invitation to join a Workspace but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.Information we collect and receiveSlack may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data (“Other Information”) in a variety of ways:Customer Data. Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer (“Authorised Users”) routinely submit Customer Data to Slack when using the Services.Other Information. Slack also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:Workspace and account information. To create or update a Workspace account, you or your Customer (e.g. your employer) supply Slack with an email address, phone number, password, domain and/or similar account details. For details on Workspace creation, click here. In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Slack (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address.Usage information.Services metadata. When an Authorised User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way that Authorised Users work. For example, Slack logs the Workspaces, channels, people, features, content and links that you view or interact with, the types of files shared and what Third-Party Services are used (if any).Log data. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.Device information. Slack collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.Location information. We receive information from you, your Customer and other third parties that helps us to approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine your approximate location. Slack may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device.Cookie information. Slack uses a variety of cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services to help us collect Other Information. For more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out opportunities and other options, please see our Cookie policy.Third-Party Services. A Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third-Party Services for its Workspace. Typically, Third-Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and a Customer can permit its Authorised Users to enable and disable these integrations for its Workspace. Slack may also develop and offer Slack applications that connect the Services with a Third-Party Service. Once enabled, the provider of a Third-Party Service may share certain information with Slack. For example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive the user name and email address of Authorised Users, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to Slack to facilitate the integration. Authorised Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third-Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Slack. When a Third-Party Service is enabled, Slack is authorised to connect and access Other Information made available to Slack in accordance with our agreement with the Third-Party Provider and any permission(s) granted by the Customer (including by its Authorised User(s)). We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third-Party Services when connecting them to the Services. For more information on Third-Party Services, click here.Contact information. In accordance with the consent process provided by your device or other third-party API, any contact information that an Authorised User chooses to import (such as an address book from a device or API) is collected when using the Services.Third-Party data. Slack may receive data about organisations, industries, lists of companies that are customers, website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information that we collect and might include aggregate-level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to postcodes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.Additional information provided to Slack. We also receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or in other ways, such as if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, enrol in a certification programme or other educational programme hosted by Slack or a vendor, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Slack.Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively “Information”).

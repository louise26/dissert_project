Retargeting uses cookies to identify users who visit a website showing a particular brand of goods or services and then targets advertisements of that brand to that user on other websites.Who we share the information withUsage Data is also either collected directly by, or disclosed to, certain other providers during the course of a session using any Platform for use by those other providers for a range of purposes, including to:  distribute direct marketing materials from Radiopaedia (such as via MailChimp)  connect to social networks (such as via links to Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and other platforms within the Platforms)  pay commission to our affiliates (see below)  target advertising (e.g. Healthcare Communication NetworkSM - their privacy policy is available here)  We share User Information when you have opted in to receive direct marketing material (e.g. via Customer.io) and, if you are a registered user, to other users of the Platforms via your user profile.Over the past 12 months, we have disclosed personal information to third parties for the following purposes (note that not all of these will apply to everyone):  targeting advertising: we use a third-party to provide monetization technologies for our site. you can review their privacy and cookie policy here.  distributing direct marketing materials from Radipaedia using third-party providers (for example, MailChimp)  collecting information necessary to pay commission to our affiliates (see below)  connecting your account to third-party payment providers (such as Stripe.com; only if you have chosen to do so by becoming a Radiopaedia Supporter or purchasing a course)  There also may be times when we are legally required to disclose personal data, such as to regulators, law enforcement bodies, government agencies, courts or other third parties where we think it’s necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to exercise our legal rights. Information Transferred or Stored OverseasMany of those other providers are located overseas and Usage Data disclosed to them may be stored on servers located overseas. Similarly, while we operate out of Australia and may store Usage Information and Usage Data on servers located there, some may be stored on servers located overseas and/or managed by third parties.   When we do transfer data, we will make sure that there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect your personal data.For individuals in the European Union (EU), this means that your personal data will be transferred outside of the EU.  EU personal data will only be transferred to countries that have been identified as providing adequate protection for EU data (such as New Zealand) or to a third party where we have approved transfer mechanisms in place – this means that we have either entered into an appropriate Data Processing Agreement or by ensuring that the entity has appropriate data protection in place.For further information about how each of the other providers referred to above handles personal information (which may include your Usage Data and User Information), we recommend that you visit their respective websites and read their respective privacy policies.A Note on Affiliate LinksOur Platforms contain various affiliate marketing links, which mean that we may be paid commission on sales of the products and services that are listed on those Platforms. These links do not influence the editorial content posted on the Platforms in any way.When you click on an affiliate link, a cookie is placed to help optimize the affiliate program. Some Usage Data is sent to our affiliate partners.Anonymity of cases/imagesIt is a requirement of the Terms of Use that all patient cases uploaded to any Platform by each user are de-identified such that the identity of each patient to whom the content included in the case relates (e.g. radiographic images and case notes) is not reasonably identifiable. This applies to all images uploaded to any Platform including, but not limited to, part of a case (public, unlisted or draft), multiple-choice question, slide, diagram, blog post.If you become aware of any case from which you feel you (as a patient) or another person is reasonably identifiable, please contact us immediately at privacy@radiopaedia.org.Information which should NOT appear on any patient cases uploaded to any Platform (based on HIPAA guidelines) includes, but is not limited to:  address, including full or partial postal code  telephone or fax numbers or contact information  unique identifying numbers (e.g. UR, MRN, HID etc..)  medical device identifiers (e.g serial numbers)  web or internet protocol addresses containing any link to the patient  facial photograph or comparable image  Additionally, if a case is, for one reason or another, unique in such a way that could lead to the identification of an individual from the images alone, then it should not be uploaded. This means that a case which has, for example, been featured in the media or shows particularly rare symptoms is usually inappropriate for upload. Similarly, the textual information accompanying the text should also be devoid of identifying information, and devoid of other unnecessary information which could aid in the identification of a patient.Note: Our privacy policy does not override the individual policies of institutions, and users should ensure that they are using images within their local guidelines.We take patient privacy very seriously, and failure to abide by these rules constitutes a breach of our privacy policy and Terms of Use. If you upload a case containing patient information, or from which a person is otherwise reasonably identifiable, your case will be deleted from the Platforms immediately upon our becoming aware of its existence and we may take such action against you as permitted under the Terms of Use.Our commitment to data securityTo prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.How you can access or correct your information or opt-outOnline tracking by Us and Third PartiesPlease note that at present we do not change what we do based on whether you have the Do Not Track setting (if available) enabled in your web browser and that setting will not prevent us from collecting Usage Data or authorizing other providers to do so.Cookies, Your say and How to 'Opt-out'You can contact us to request access to the User Information, and any other personal information, that we may hold.

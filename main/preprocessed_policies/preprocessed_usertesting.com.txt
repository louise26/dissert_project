In connection with the Site, Platform, and Services, UserTesting may collect, record, and analyze information about Visitors, including its Customers and Contributors, which may include individually identifiable information that would allow UserTesting to determine the actual identity of or contact information of a specific individual, billing information, account settings, and other data ("Personal Data").Who is my data controller?Certain data protection and privacy laws, such as the GDPR, differentiate between "controllers" and "processors" of personal information. A "controller" decides why and how to process personal information. A "processor" processes personal information on behalf of a controller based on the controller's instructions.For Visitors, the Company is the controller, to the extent that we collect or you provide your Personal Data.For Contributors, the Company is the controller of the personal information collected from you by the Company, except for the information collected by our Customers through a Test.For Customers, you are the controller of the data we collect from you for us to provide you with access to our Platform or Services, except for the IP address you use for access to the Platform, which we control.How we collect and use your dataHow we collect Personal Data depends on how and why you use our Sites, our Platform, and/or our Services.We collect Personal Data directly when you submit it to us, as a Visitor, Contributor, or Customer, as well as indirectly, such as through the use of automated technologies or from third parties. To help keep our databases current and to provide you the most relevant content and experiences, we may combine information provided by you with information from third-party sources, in accordance with applicable laws. For example, the size, industry, and other information about the company you work for (where you have provided company name) may be obtained from sources including professional networking sites and information service providers. We provide more information about how we collect Personal Data below.UserTesting uses your Personal Data for certain legitimate business purposes, including the following:to provide you access to and use of the Platform and Services, including registering as a Customer or a Contributor,to deliver Services to our Customers, including Recordings created by Contributors,to improve and enhance your experience with the Platform and Services, including the content and general administration of the Platform and Services,to retain records as may be required for tax, legal, and financial purposes,to understand how you access, use and interact with the Services in order to provide technical functionality, develop new products and services, and analyze your use of the Services,to communicate with you,to provide you with customer support in connection with your use of the Services,to detect fraud, illegal activities, or security breaches,to receive and make payments, andto provide information to regulatory bodies when legally required.In the sections below, we are more specific about the purposes for which we use each category of data.Data provided by or collected from our Visitors ("Visitor Data")When Visitors use or browse one of our Sites, we collect their IP addresses and usage information such as page views, clicks, and browser type.If a Visitor submits a request for a trial on our Site, chats with us for support, requests to watch a webinar, subscribes to our blog or other news, submits a request through our Contact Us form, or requests to download a whitepaper or other content, we may also collect the Visitor’s: name, title, email, phone number, company name, country and IP address.We use this Visitor Data to provide the Visitor with the information or materials requested, including marketing materials, newsletters and other related content, perform analytics on how the Site, Platform, and Services are used, improve the use of the Site, Platform, or Services, and for other legitimate business purposes.Data provided by or collected from our Contributors ("Contributor Data")Account DataWhen a Contributor creates an account with UserTesting, we will collect the Contributor’s name, username, and password, zip code, and email address.We may also ask each Contributor to provide us with additional information necessary or helpful for UserTesting to be able to determine which Tests are best directed to that Contributor. Examples of information we may collect are: birth year; gender; household income range; country; web expertise; presence of children (including gender and birth years); employment status, industry; company size; job role seniority; gaming genres; web browsers; social networks; languages spoken; race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and other sensitive personal data, which may be provided on a voluntary basis and only collected as permitted by applicable law; devices owned (e.g. computer, smartphone, tablet); and computer operating system.UserTesting uses Contributor Data to provide and improve its Services, pay Contributors, provide information on how to use our Platform and Services to our Contributors, and for other legitimate business purposes.RecordingsAs a Contributor takes part in a Test, we make a recording of the Contributor’s activities, which may include recordings of the Contributor’s voice, screen content, face recordings, screen recordings, browser content, screen interactions including mouse movement and clicking, text input, device configurations, and any background audio or video content ("Recordings").Intellectual property rights in the Recordings, which may include Personal Data and face Recordings, are assigned by Contributors to UserTesting under the terms of the Contributor Terms of Service in consideration for Contributors’ use of the Platform and Services. Face Recordings are owned by and controlled by the Customer or UserTesting, as applicable.UserTesting uses Recordings to provide Services to Customers, to market its products and services, to protect against fraudulent or illegal activity, to improve the UserTesting Platform and Services and for other legitimate business purposes.Privacy for MinorsFrom time to time, UserTesting’s Customers seek feedback from minor children (ages 17 and younger) using the Platform for Tests specifically designed for children. To facilitate those Tests, we require that a parent or legal guardian consent prior to a child engaging in a Test through their parent’s or legal guardian’s Contributor account. Our Customers are required to ensure that Tests which are specifically designed for children are for age-appropriate products and services and the Recording is limited to only captures the child’s voice. No other information is to be collected about the child by the Customer. The child’s responses may be used for the same purposes and subject to the same obligations, restrictions and conditions as any other similarly-situated Contributor response. By accepting and authorizing a Test for a child, the parent or legal guardian (as applicable) is consenting to such child’s participation in the Tests through the Platform for the benefit of the Customer. We may require that Customers sign additional terms for testing with children. In the event a parent has a reason to believe that their child is participating in a Test administered via the Platform without authorization, or wishes to exercise any of the parental rights set forth in this section or applicable law, such parent may contact UserTesting at 660 4th Street #246, San Francisco, CA 94107, by calling 1 (888) 877‒1882 or by email at privacy@usertesting.com.Data provided by our Customers ("Customer Data")During a Customer’s use of the Platform and Services, Customer’s employees are asked to provide information such as name and contact information, including email address, address, telephone, or other relevant Personal Data.Customer Data is used by UserTesting to identify each Customer and provide them with access to the Platform and Services, to bill Customers, and to meet UserTesting’s contractual obligations.

The total refund sum is the number of course sessions not yet fulfilled times the rate of each individual course minus the service charge and exchange differences of the original total calculated course fee of the lesson agreement.The Proposed Conflict SettlementIf there is refund dispute resulting from any lesson agreement, with the exception of written requests by student members or teacher members, it will be dealt with according to company conflict resolution procedures.

This company may, depending on specific circumstances, invite both parties of the lesson agreement to make statements at a specified location.Dispute Settlement ProcessAfter this company has made a comprehensive study of all the evidence, it must decide whether or not the lesson agreement shall continue to be in effect. If one party has just reason to terminate the lesson agreement, this company shall, depending on specific circumstances, change relevant information on this website or refund student members who have already paid. If the facts are not clear, and there is absence of grounds of justification, this company may, depending on specific circumstances, proceed with student member refunds and separately negotiate a method of compensation with the teacher members.The abovementioned extent of refunding and its processing method apply mutatis mutandis to this section’s “Principles of Dispute Settlements.”AmazingTalkerAbout UsBlogJob OpportunitiesJoin AmazingTalkerFind students© AmazingTalker, Inc.Sitemaps・Privacy And Terms

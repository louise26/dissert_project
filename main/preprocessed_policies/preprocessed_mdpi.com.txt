Feature Papers represent the most advanced research with significant potential for high impact in the field. Feature  Papers are submitted upon individual invitation or recommendation by the scientific editors and undergo peer review  The Feature Paper can be either an original research article, a substantial novel research study that often involves  several techniques or approaches, or a comprehensive review paper with concise and precise updates on the latest  progress in the field that systematically reviews the most exciting advances in scientific literature. This type of  paper provides an outlook on future directions of research or possible applications.  Editor’s Choice articles are based on recommendations by the scientific editors of MDPI journals from around the world.  Editors select a small number of articles recently published in the journal that they believe will be particularly  interesting to authors, or important in this field. The aim is to provide a snapshot of some of the most exciting work  published in the various research areas of the journal.  You seem to have javascript disabled.

We strive to protect your privacy. Please read more for details.Thank you for visiting the METAsrc Privacy Policy. METAsrc LLC (“METAsrc”, “we”, “us”) owns and operates www.metasrc.com. This privacy policy explains how METAsrc collects, uses, and otherwise processes information through your use of our products and services available on our website www.metasrc.com (“website”, “site”).By continuing to use this website, you hereby confirm that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and acknowledge that we will process all information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data.Personal data that has been rendered anonymous in such a way that the individual is not or no longer identifiable is no longer considered personal data. For data to be truly anonymized, the anonymization must be irreversible.DATA WE COLLECTIn short, we do not store or collect personal data. The only data we collect from you is made anonymous, so it is no longer considered personal data.This data is collected for the purpose of log files and traffic analytics through Google Analytics and requires the use of cookies provided by Google.Like many other websites, www.metasrc.com makes use of log files using Google Analytics. These files merely log visitors to the site - usually a standard procedure for hosting companies and a part of hosting services's analytics. The information inside the log files include anonymized internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, region, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. The IP addresses stored in these log files are anonymized so they are not personally traceable to the user. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement around the site, and gather general but not personally identifiable demographic information. This means that the data we store is not personally traceable back to you, and has therefore been rendered anonymous. Google Analytics data will be automatically deleted after a maximum of 26 months.You may opt out of Google Analytics at any time. One method is to install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on from Google, located here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.Google is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of Google Analytics data.

California Privacy Notice
Effective July 1, 2020
This Privacy Notice contains disclosures required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and applies only to California residents.
This Privacy Notice describes Instructure’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal information as defined in the CCPA, as well as your rights with respect to that personal information. It applies when Instructure is acting as a “business” as defined by the CCPA, for example, when we collect personal information through our corporate websites, and it pertains to and supplements the Instructure Marketing Privacy Policy.
Instructure also processes personal information through our products on behalf of our customers, in order to provide services to our customers. Under the CCPA, when Instructure acts on behalf of its customers, Instructure processes personal information as a “service provider,” a designation which is not subject to the disclosures and rights set forth in this Privacy Notice. To exercise your rights with respect to that personal information, you must contact the relevant Instructure customer—for example, the school you attended or company you worked for when you used an Instructure product. Instructure will cooperate with that business to fulfill your request if they request that we do so. To learn more about how Instructure treats personal information when acting as a service provider, please view the Instructure Product Privacy Policy.
Consumers with disabilities may access this notice by using a screen reader or contacting Instructure for further assistance.

Privacy PolicyOverviewBelow you will find our Privacy Policy which tells you about how we will process your personal data and about rights that you have under data protection. We strongly recommend that you familiarise yourself with this Privacy Policy. However, we understand that people have busy lives and so want to provide you with a quick overview of how we will use your personal data – please remember though that this first section is an overview only and should not be read instead of reading the full Privacy Policy below.
We process your personal data for the purposes discussed in detail below, but the two main purposes are to enable us to provide you with a service and to comply with our regulatory obligations, specifically:
On the first of these, in order for us to offer you with a service we will need you to register a user account and provide bank details to deposit money.
On the regulatory aspect, we are required to monitor our customers and to keep records of transactions to ensure that we are offering a fair, responsible and safe service – and this includes verifying your age and monitoring our customers to ensure that they are gambling within their means.
IntroductionThis Privacy Policy applies to our websites, applications, goods and services that link to this policy or which do not have a separate privacy policy. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide you with information about how we use your personal data. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time-to-time so we recommend that you review it regularly, however where we make material changes, we will make sure to alert you to this.Who is the Controller?The controller (formerly known as data controller) of your personal data is Stars Interactive Limited of Douglas Bay Complex, King Edward Road, Onchan, Isle of Man, IM3 1DZ. This is who we refer to when saying "we", "our" and "us" etc.And, what about the Data Protection Officer, or is it DPO?Yes, we have appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO). While our DPO can be reached at dpo@starsgroup.com, our Customer Service team will be your initial point of contact if you wish to exercise your rights. Please see the 'Your Rights' section below.What is meant by the "Group"?Reference to the Group within this Privacy Policy means Flutter Entertainment plc and all or any of its direct or indirect subsidiary undertakings, joint venture partners, and their related companies wherever located in the world as may exist from time to time including, but not limited to, Paddy Power, Betfair, Timeform, Sportsbet, BetEasy, FanDuel, TVG, Adjarabet, Sky Betting and Gaming, Full Tilt, PokerStars and FOX Bet. How we collect your personal dataIn order to provide you services, you will need to create a user account. When creating this user account, you will need to submit certain personal data such as your name, age, address and email.

Where you contact us, we will process any personal data you provide in these communications.
We may also collect personal data from third party service providers, such as Experian and fraud prevention companies.
Finally, we also use "cookies" and similar technologies which may collect certain information about you, such as your devices' IP addresses and online activity, some of which will constitute your personal data. You can learn more about the cookies we use in the 'Cookies' section below.How will we use your personal dataIn accordance with data protection laws, we will only process your personal data when we have a lawful basis for doing so in respect of your personal data.

This occurs where a customer is registered with both brands but only has applied a responsible gambling control with one of the brands. This process will happen on an ongoing basis and as such we will process personal data of Sky Betting & Gaming customers who are based in the UK. Where responsible gaming measures need to be replicated, personal data to identify our customers will be sent back to Sky Betting & Gaming. If you would like to understand more about how Sky Betting & Gaming will process your personal data then please visit their privacy policy here.
Please be aware that where the matching described above indicates that a customer has self-excluded with one brand and not the other, the other brand will automatically apply a self-exclusion.

This will include details of any Accessibility Data or other health data that you share with us (for example, when ordering services or arranging for installation or service visits) when you contact us.
We may also hold your Identity, Contact and Financial Data for you to manage a Hyperoptic customer’s account or billing arrangements (at that customer’s or your request).
When you order services from us, we may make enquiries about you for credit reference purposes. These enquires include searching your records held by any credit reference agencies or any fraud prevention scheme.

Transaction Data
We will collect and hold details of orders you make through our Website, by telephone or on paper forms and details of any payments you have made and any products/equipment supplied – e.g. routers.
Usage and Technical Data
When you use our services, we will automatically collect your Usage Data. When you (or someone using your Hyperoptic broadband or telephone service) use Hyperoptic’s network to make a telephone call or connect to the internet, we keep a record of that call (including the number called) so we can charge for it. We also receive information from other operators about calls made over our network, where we need that information for connecting and billing purposes. We will also collect information about your use of our services (such as the amount of time you spend online), which we will use to manage our network and for billing.
If someone abuses or damages the Hyperoptic telephone network, for example by making offensive or nuisance calls, we may keep information relating to that abuse.

We may collect information about your computer, including your IP address, operating system and browser type, to help keep our network running smoothly. Unless this information is needed for a service enquiry specific to your service, this is used as aggregated statistical information about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.
We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them. We may ask you questions, from time to time, about how you use the services we provide, other services you would like us to provide in the future and about other things, such as information about your lifestyle.

5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Our partners
We may sometimes need to share your personal data with the types of third party listed below:
Our partner organisations and subcontractors who provide some of the services on our behalf
Credit reference agencies (to carry out credit checks) and debt recovery agencies (if you do not pay your bills)
Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our Website
IT and system administration services service providers
Professional advisers including lawyers, auditors and insurers
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business with
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
Other providers we work with
We may from time to time work with other service providers (such as Sky UK Limited) who offer content and other services which are complementary to our services. We may ask you if you would like us to share your details with these third parties so that you can receive their services. We will tell you what details we need to share and will only ever provide your details to these types of third party if you have specifically agreed that you want us to.
If you have agreed to us sharing your details in this way, the third party service provider will act as a data controller in respect of your details that we share with them and their use of your details will be subject to their own privacy notices and policies. Please note that we do not recommend or endorse any third party services and it is your responsibility to make sure that you obtain all necessary information to decide whether or not you want to receive such third party services.
Your nominated third parties
If, as a Hyperoptic customer, you have nominated a third party to manage your Hyperoptic account or billing arrangements, you agree that this may involve that third party having access to and being able to make changes to your Hyperoptic account details and/or billing arrangements (as applicable) either through Hyperoptic’s website or by contacting Customer Support. We accept no responsibility in relation to you choosing a third party to manage your account or billing arrangements or in relation to their use or misuse of such of your personal information to which they have access under these arrangements.
Legal obligations
We may also disclose your personal data to a third party if we are under a duty to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of law enforcement, fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
We share your personal data within Hyperoptic’s organisation which involves transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our divisions to follow the same rules when processing your personal data to ensure its security. These rules are called "model clauses".
In addition, some of our third party suppliers are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
The third party country has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or
The service provider has provided adequate safeguards to ensure that individuals rights are enforceable and legal remedies are available.
7. DATA SECURITY
We have in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We also have in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and the ICO (the UK supervisory authority) of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or you have chosen) a customer ID, password(s) or log-ins to allow you to can access certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping these confidential. You are responsible for how our services are used from your account and for keeping your account information secret. Please keep this information safe, and do not share it with others.
Unfortunately, sending information using the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of the data you send to our Website; you take the risk for this. Once we have received your information, we will try our best to keep it secure. This includes using strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
Our Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and others associated with us. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy and cookie policies. Hyperoptic accepts no responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you send any personal data to these websites.
8. DATA RETENTION
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for at least 7 years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
You have various rights in relation to your personal data – these are set out in detail below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email us: dataprotection@hyperoptic.com
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete your personal data when we no longer need it. You may also ask us to delete your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with a legal obligation. However, we may not be able to comply with your request of erasure, for example, if we are required to retain your personal data for legal reasons. We will let you know if this is the case.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. You also have the right to object where we are relying on a legitimate interest but you feel the processing impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. You may ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you do not think the data we hold is accurate, whilst we verify its accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no longer need to process it but you require us to store it in relation to a legal claim; or (d) if you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will if feasible practically provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to information which we process by automated means and use to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data (for example, for marketing purposes). However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data or to exercise any of your other rights. However, if we feel that your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee or we may let you know that we are refusing to comply with your request. If we refuse your request, we will explain why and you will be entitled to raise the issue with the ICO.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data or to exercise any of your other rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We will respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days of receipt and, if possible, achieve a satisfactory resolution within that time period. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
10. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
Any changes we may make to this Privacy Policy in the future will be posted on this page. You should check this page from time to time for any changes we made. We may also email you about these changes, if you are a customer of Hyperoptic.

If we do not resolve it to your satisfaction, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk).

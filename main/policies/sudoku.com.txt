Rise Codes Ltd. Partner Ad Services Privacy Policy
Rise Codes Ltd.
(“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides this privacy policy to describe how
we collect, use, and share the information related to the partner ad services
provided by us, including the video ad player offered for websites (the
“Service”).  This privacy policy does not govern Company’s other practices.  .
Information We Collect
We
collect information about a device through the publisher’s website that uses
the Service.  Specifically, we collect
a.
cookie identifiers,
b.
IP address,
c.
general technical information about the browser and operating systems,
d.
time zone and the country from which a request is sent (based on the request IP
address),
e.
the name of the website from which an ad is served, and
f.
interactions with the ads shown through the Service, such as an indication of
whether an ad was viewed or clicked on.
We
may also collect information about a device from our advertising partners, such
as a cookie identifier that may be associated with you and the total amount of
revenues received as a result of advertising served to a specific cookie
identifier.
How We Use the Information We Collect
We may use information about you for any
lawful purpose, including the following business and commercial purposes:
o   To operate and improve our Service,
including to enable the delivery of ads;
o
To
maintain the security of our Service, including to detect and protect against
security incidents, fraud, and illegal activity;
o
For
legal compliance;
o   To resolve any dispute we may have with
you or third parties, protect Companys rights, and to enforce our agreements
with third parties; or
o   As otherwise disclosed at the time
information is collected.
How We Share the Information We Collect
We
may share the information we collect with other parties, including the
following:
o
With
advertising and marketing customers and partners for the purposes of receiving, or delivering, ads from such
customers and partners, as well as for attribution purposes. The list of such
third parties can be found here https://risecodes.com/buyers.pdf
o
With
our affiliates; or
o
With
our service providers for
purposes such as analytics, reporting, and storage.
We
may also share information with other parties in certain circumstances,
including the following:
o    As part of a
corporate sale, merger, or acquisition, or other transfer of all or part of our
assets, including as part of a bankruptcy proceeding;
o    Pursuant to a
subpoena, court order, governmental inquiry, or other legal process or as
otherwise required by law or to protect our rights or the rights of third
parties; or
o    With your consent.
We
may share information that has been de-identified or aggregated without
limitation.
Your Choices
Company’s
Service allows websites, apps, and other online properties to show video ads to
their users.  In connection with the Service, we may collect information across
these nonaffiliated properties over time.  While our partners and customers may
engage in interest-based advertising, Company itself does not conduct
interest-based advertising through the Service. Interest-based advertising is
advertising that is tailored to be more relevant to you based on your Web
browsing and/or app usage history across nonaffiliated properties over time.
You may wish to
visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Webchoices tool at
www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt
out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in the DAA
self-regulatory program.  If you delete your cookies or use a different browser
or mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choices exercised through
the DAA Webchoices tool.  Note that electing to opt out will not stop
advertising from appearing in your browser or applications.  It may make the
ads you see less relevant to your interests.
Your browser
may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies; however, if
you use these tools, the websites you visit may not function as intended.
Third-Party Links
Advertisements
delivered by our partners through the Service may link to third-party websites
or mobile apps. Please be advised that we are not responsible for the privacy
practices of such other websites or mobile apps and note that the privacy
practices of such third parties are not covered by this privacy policy. We
encourage you to review the privacy policies of other websites or apps that you
use to learn about their privacy practices.
Data Retention
We
will process and store information only for the period necessary to achieve the
purpose of the storage, or as permitted by law.  The criteria used to determine
the period of storage of information is the respective statutory retention
period.  After expiration of that period, the corresponding information is
routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of
a contract or the initiation of a contract.
International Privacy Rights
This
section contains certain disclosures required by the EU General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”) and applies only to “personal data,” as defined by the
GDPR, associated with individuals who we deem to be located in the European
Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland.
Purpose
and Basis of Processing –
If we serve, or share information with advertising partners that use such
information for serving personalized ads, we will process personal data for
such purpose with your consent. On other occasions, we may process personal
data where necessary to fulfill a contract or where required to do this by law.
We may also process personal data when it is in our legitimate interests to do
this, such as operating our Service and conducting research. We do so when our
legitimate interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
International
Transfers – Please
be aware that the personal data we collect may be transferred to and maintained
on servers or databases located outside your state, province, country, or other
jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your
location. If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom,
or Switzerland, we will transfer your information to the United States to our
partners based on EU standard contractual clauses (“Model Contracts”) for
transfers of personal data. If you wish to receive a copy of these clauses,
please contact us at rise-engage-privacy@risecodes.com.
Data Subject Rights – Please note that you have the
following rights, subject to certain exceptions and limitations:
o
The
right to request access
to the personal data we hold about you;
o
The
right to request that we rectify or erase your personal data;
o
The
right to request that we restrict or block the processing of your personal
data;
o
Under
certain circumstances, the right to data portability; and
o   Where we previously
obtained your consent, the right to withdraw consent to processing your
personal data.
To submit a request for exercising your
rights, please send an email with your request to the following address:
rise-engage-privacy@risecodes.com. Please note that we will process your
request subject to verification of your identity. Please also be aware that we
may be unable to afford these rights to you under certain circumstances, such
as if we are legally prevented from doing so.
Complaint
to Supervisory Authority –
You also have the right to file a complaint with the relevant supervisory
authority (e.g. of your country or domicile) where Company has not addressed
your concerns.
California Privacy Rights
This
section contains disclosures required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)
and applies only to “personal information” that is subject to the CCPA.
In
many cases, we act as a service provider to collect personal information from,
or on behalf of, customers who use our Service. These customers have their own
privacy policies that describe how they use information. To the extent that we
are processing personal information subject to the CCPA on behalf of a customer
in our role as a service provider, you should reach out to that customer
directly to exercise your rights under the CCPA.
The
remainder of this section provides disclosures for cases where we process
personal information about you and are not acting as a service provider to a
customer.

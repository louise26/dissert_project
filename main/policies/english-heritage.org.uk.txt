If you have provided details for someone else, for example by purchasing a gift for them, we will not contact that person until they have been given the opportunity to let us know their communication preferences.
If you have contacted us on behalf of an organisation, for example making an Educational Booking or a Travel Trade enquiry, we will also store details of individuals in their professional capacity.

We also buy anonymous external data (such as census data, Experian’s Mosaic consumer data) and may combine it with personal data to help us assist customers in finding the services and products that they are looking to receive from us.

For a small number of people, where we want to better understand the interest of individuals in supporting the work of English Heritage, we may seek information about their interests and preferences before contacting them, but only if we feel there is a legitimate interest to do so.
The information we gather may relate to: career and business networks, voluntary roles including trusteeships, residential location, family (not including information about children unless given personally or made public by the individual concerned), wealth and assets, hobbies and interests and previous philanthropy.
We use these details to improve our understanding of individuals’ interests and preferences. We will contact these few individuals to notify them of our privacy policy no later than one month following collection of any data relating to them.
We may use a number of sources to carry out our work, including printed and online newspapers and publications, charity and company websites, and the websites of organisations similar to us. From time to time we may use specialist companies to help us identify individuals who we think might be interested in supporting us and the work we do. This will only be done when individuals give permission to the relevant third party organisations to share the data they hold on them, or if the data is already available publicly.

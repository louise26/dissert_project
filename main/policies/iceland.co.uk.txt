Privacy Policy
Coronavirus Covid-19 Update
What information have we received?
The Government has provided us with basic contact details of people who it, in conjunction with the NHS, has determined are potentially medically vulnerable during the Covid-19 pandemic, or people who have self-declared themselves to the Government as potentially medically vulnerable and who have requested assistance with access to food.
We have not received any health information, or details of any medical conditions or care arrangements.
How are we using this information?
Iceland has used this information to identify customers within our records, so that we can contact them to offer priority access to our online delivery slots. This is so we can assist as many of our potentially vulnerable customers to get the food they need during this difficult time. Where we don't already hold an email address on our customer accounts, we may use the email address provided by the Government to make contact. If we do this, then we will not use it for any other purpose, or add it to our records, unless our customer registers that email address with us.
We may also respond to requests for other customers to be placed within the priority access process and identify their accounts as part of this process.
Why are we using this information?
We have not been given any information about health conditions, but we understand that those on the list have a health condition in order to be included in the Government's list. Our legal reason for using the personal information on the list is because there is a substantial public interest in making sure that customers who have been told to 'shield' by the Government, have priority access to online delivery slots at this time. Our legal reason for holding and using most of our customer information is because it is in our legitimate interests to do so, and so that we can fulfil our contractual obligations to you as our customer. Further details on this can be found below. We have carefully assessed our legitimate business interests and the potential impact on individuals to ensure that their privacy and rights are protected throughout this process.
How long will we keep this information?
We will only keep the information provided by the Government, and/or the fact that we have identified some of our customers as being entitled to priority access to delivery slots as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, for as long as it is necessary to continue to provide this service. We will securely delete this information once the current public need has ended.
General customer information will be kept and used in accordance with the remainder of our Privacy Policy, below.
What are my privacy rights?
We understand that some customers who are contacted about priority access to delivery slots may not want to be included in the priority service and/or may not want to receive any further communication about it. You can opt out by contacting the Data Protection Team at dataprotection@iceland.co.uk.
Please also see the 'Don't forget your rights' section, below, for further information.
Privacy and Cookies Policy
Protecting your privacy
At Iceland, you can trust us to deliver the best products for great value. And we want you to feel just as confident in us knowing we keep all your personal information safe and secure. We're committed to protecting your privacy, which is why we made this policy – to explain how we may collect and use your personal information, and why this makes your life easier (trust us, it does!)
Why do we collect information?
It's simple. We collect information from our customers to help us deliver and continually improve the service we offer. That means when you shop with Iceland, and/or apply for a Bonus Card, or use any of our services, we may collect personal information about you.
How do we use your information?
That's a big question. We use your information in a number of different ways — and it all depends on the information. However, without your information, we won't be able to offer all our fantastic services, such as deliver your shopping to your door, or provide you with our latest offers and updates (unless you've opted out of receiving marketing, of course). All the information we collect from you is used by us, or a trusted third-party processor acting on our behalf. Check out the tables below to see what we do, and why we do it.

The law allows us to collect and use the information set out above for a number of reasons, including:
With your consent
To perform our contracts with you, such as to deliver your shopping
Legal compliance – sometimes we don't have a choice, we are legally obliged to collect and share information, for example in relation to fraud or criminal activity
Legitimate interest – where we need to use your data as part of the running of our business to provide our excellent goods and services and we will do this in a way that does not materially impact any of your rights, freedoms or interests, for example the profiling activity we refer to below.
How long will we hold your data for?
We will keep your personal information whilst you continue to shop and interact with us, for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. We’re still working hard to get all of our systems aligned but your Bonus Card and/or online shopping account will expire two years after you last shop with us and your information will be archived after the third year. However, we are required by law to keep some data for longer periods than other types and are entitled to hold on to some information where we have a legal right to do so. In general, we will not keep your personal information for longer than seven years after you last shop with us or interact with us before we deleted it and where we don't need it or are not obliged to keep it, we will delete it before.
It's easy to opt out
With each marketing communication you receive from Iceland, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future communications, such as post, telephone, SMS and email. But you can choose to opt out at any time, that's easy too. Simply contact us and we'll take care of the rest. Just be aware that it may take up to 28 days for all of our systems to be updated.
Creating customer profiles
Whether it's frozen or fresh, for the food cupboard or fridge, we've always got exciting promotions on at Iceland. But how do we know which offers are for you? Well, to help us form a better, overall understanding of you as a customer, we combine your Bonus Card and online shopping information – to give us a clear view of your shopping habits and bring you the offers and promotions that are most relevant to you.
We call this profiling. And that's what makes every customer's Iceland experience unique – tailored just for them.
Sharing your information
We want to earn and maintain your trust. So as a rule, we do not, and will not, sell any of your personal data to any third party. That includes your personal details, such as your name, address, email address or credit card information.
However, we may share your data with the following categories of companies, as an essential part of being able to provide our services to you:
Companies that do things to run our websites, our till systems and to get your purchases to you, such as the IT companies who support our systems, payment service providers, delivery scheduling companies and the systems that support our customer services teams
Professional service providers, such as marketing agencies, advertising partners and other advisors and agents, who help us run our business, undertake market research and gather product reviews
Our security contractors, credit reference agencies, law enforcement, cybersecurity companies, fraud prevention and crime reduction agencies, so we can help tackle fraud and criminal activity and to determine risk to customer accounts. We may also receive information from these bodies and use it to keep our customers and employees safe online and in store
Companies approved by you, such as social media sites (if you choose to link your accounts to us)
We may provide third parties with aggregated but anonymised information and analytics about our customers. But before we do, we'll make sure that it does not identify you.
We may also be required to disclose your personal data to the police or other enforcement, regulatory or Government body upon a valid request to do so. These requests are assessed on a case-by-case basis and we'll always take your privacy into consideration before sharing.
Protecting your data outside the EEA
Sometimes, in order to fulfil your order, process your payment details or provide support services, we'll need to share your personal data with third parties and suppliers outside the European Economic Area – such as Australia or the USA.
But, if we do this, don't worry. We have procedures in place to ensure your data receives the same standard of protection it gets inside the EEA. For example, our contracts with third parties stipulate the standards they must follow at all times.
This means any transfer of your personal data will follow applicable laws, and we'll treat the information under the guiding principles of this Privacy Policy.
Meet our affiliate websites
When it comes to delivering the best products for great value, we can't do it all on our own.
That's why we've partnered with various trusted third-party companies to provide goods and services to you. These goods and services can be accessed through links on our website to the third-party company's microsite – a website which is owned and operated by the company, but is Iceland branded or co-branded with the relevant affiliate.
The main thing you need to know is that although some of these microsites may contain iceland.co.uk in their address, these microsites are not owned or operated by Iceland. They are governed by their own terms and conditions and privacy policies, so it's definitely worth having a read of their policies too, to see how your information may be used.
If you have any queries or concerns regarding these microsites, please contact the relevant third party, as detailed in their privacy policy, and they'll be happy to help you.
Preventing fraud
There's only one Iceland Foods. All emails you receive from Iceland will come from an email address ending in Iceland.co.uk or icelandmail.co.uk. So, if you receive any emails claiming to be from Iceland which do not end in Iceland.co.uk or Icelandmail.co.uk, these may be fraudulent and should be forwarded to Iceland at dataprotection@iceland.co.uk
Don't forget your rights
Remember: your data is your data. So, you have the right to request:
Access to the personal data we hold about you, free of charge in most cases
The correction of your personal data when incorrect, out of date or incomplete
That we stop using your personal data for direct marketing
That we stop any consent-based processing of your personal data if you withdraw that consent
That we delete your data, or stop processing it or collecting it, in some circumstances
That we transfer or port elements of your data either to you or another service provider
You can contact us to request to exercise these rights at any time as follows:
To ask for your information to be updated, please use your online Iceland account, or contact our customer services team.
For any of the others, please contact our Data Protection Officer, Legal Department, Iceland Foods Ltd, Second Avenue, Deeside Industrial Park, Deeside, Flintshire, CH5 2NW, or email dataprotection@iceland.co.uk
We want to provide the best service to you, so we'll act on your requests where we can. But, sometimes, we may not be able to or may not be required to. If we choose not to action your request, we'll explain the reasons for our refusal.
Your right to withdraw consent
Whenever you give us your consent to use your personal data, you have the right to change your mind at any time and withdraw that consent. The easiest way to withdraw is to contact our helpful customer services team. Lots of the uses of your information set out in the table above are not based on your consent and therefore, we may continue to use your data, where we are legally allowed to.
Where we rely on our legitimate interest
In cases where we are processing your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interest, you can ask us to stop for reasons connected to your individual situation.
We must then do so, unless we believe we have a legitimate overriding reason to continue processing your personal data. If we choose not to action your request, we'll explain the reasons for our refusal.
Checking your identity
To protect the confidentiality of your information, we will ask you to verify your identity before proceeding with any request you make under this Privacy Notice.
If you have authorised a third party to submit a request on your behalf, that's fine too. We will just ask them to prove they have your permission to act.
Filing a complaint
We're always happy to help you with any issues you may have. However, if you'd like to make a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office, please visit www.ico.org.uk
Stay safe and secure
We work hard to make our websites as safe as possible. Which is why, if you register to use secured parts of the website, you may be asked to create a password.
Like with any password, you must keep this password confidential, must not disclose it or share it with anyone and will be responsible for all activities that occur under your password. If you know or suspect that someone else knows your password, you should notify us immediately (please see the ‘Contact us' section)
If we think there has been or is likely to be a breach of security or misuse of the website, you'll be the first to know. We may ask you to change your password or suspend your account until we've verified your identity and/or until your account has been secured.
Cookies (we're talking data, not dough)
We want to give each of our customers a personalised experience on our website. And cookies help us do just that. Cookies help us tell you apart from other users of our website, creating a more seamless experience – made just for you.
What are cookies and how are they used?
A cookie is a small, harmless text file placed on your computer, tablet or mobile phone by lots of the websites that you visit. You can set your browser to reject cookies, but this will affect your ability to use certain features and shop online.
What types of cookies are there?
There are four main types of cookies – here's how and why we use them:
Essential cookies
Essential cookies are – well – essential to use our website. They let you move around the site and use all its fantastic features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, the services that make your life easier, like shopping baskets or shopping lists, wouldn't be a thing. See, essential!
Performance cookies
These cookies collect information about how visitors use our website – like which pages you go to most often, or if you get error messages from web pages. These cookies don't collect information that could identify you. In fact, all information is aggregated and anonymous. It's only used to improve how our website performs.
Functionality cookies
You know when a website remembers your past purchases, or details like your username to help you sign in faster? That's a functional cookie. They provide more personal features to enhance your experience. Again, the information these cookies collect may be anonymised, and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
Targeted advertising cookies
We know, we know. No one wants to see adverts. But at least with cookies, you'll see adverts that are more relevant to you. In fact, these cookies limit the number of times you see an advert, and measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.
They are usually placed by advertising networks, but only with our permission. These cookies remember that you have visited a website, and share this information with other organisations such as advertisers. So, like our profiling system, every time you interact with Iceland online, we're refining an experience to suit you.
Your choice of cookies
By using our site, you agree to us placing these cookies on your device and accessing them when you visit the site in the future.

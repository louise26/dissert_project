Privacy Policy
Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you, how we may use it, and the steps we
take to ensure that it is kept secure. It also explains your rights and how to contact us. When we say
“Quidco”, “we”, “us” or “our”, we are referring to the particular group businesses that is responsible for
processing your data – the controller - or (according to the context) to the Quidco Service you use.
The controller of your data is Maple Syrup Media Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, under
company registration number 05498276.
The words we use in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as in the Quidco Account Holder
Agreement.
We collect and process data that relates to you (called "perosnal data") for the purposes of the following
Quidco Services:
The Quidco cashback service for web- and app-based transactions
The Quidco High Street cashback service for in-store purchases
The Quidco Compare cashback service for price comparison service
The Quidco ClickSnap cashback service for instore supermarket purchases
The Quidco Hotels cashback service for travel bookings
The Quidco Payout service for gift card exchange services
Unless otherwise indicated, this Privacy Policy applies to each of these Quidco Services.
What information do we collect?
We collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped
together as follows:
Claims Data includes data you provide concerning a purchase made from a retailer as
part of the process of raising and processing a cashback claim on your behalf.
Contact Data includes postcode, address, email address and telephone numbers.
Customer Service Contact Data includes records of your contact with our customer care
team, including live chat, telephone conversations, online tickets raised, emails and contacts through
any other customer contact channels.
Financial Data includes bank account, PayPal account and payment card (including
Identifier Card and Cashback Payout Method) details.
Identity Data includes first name, last name, username, date of birth, gender or
similar identifier. For Quidco Compare, Identity Data also includes marital status.
Marketing and Communications Data includes your preferences for receiving marketing
from us and your communication preferences.
Profile Data includes your username and password, purchases or orders made by you,
cashback allocated to you, your interests, preferences, feedback, reviews and survey responses.
Technical Data includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type
and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and
platform and other technology on the devices you use to access Quidco.
Transaction Data includes details about Cashback payments that may be due to you and
details of transactions that may give rise to Cashback.
Usage Data includes information about how you use Quidco and about the websites that
you accessed prior to accessing Quidco.
We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data.
Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is put together in an aggregated and anonymous
manner (so that your identity and personal data are not accessible) and does not constitute personal data
for legal purposes. For example, we may aggregate your Usage and Transaction Data and (a) use it for
internal management purposes, and (b) share it with current or prospective retailers. This type of
information includes, for example, usage of an Account Holder's Cashback Payout Method, including the types
of product that the individual Account Holder purchases, the value of those purchases and the web, app,
instore or other channels through which the purchases are made.
How is your personal data collected?
We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:
Direct interactions. You may give us your Identity, Contact and Financial Data by filling in forms or by
corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes personal data you provide when
you:
Create an account with Quidco;
Use a Quidco Service;
Request marketing to be sent to you;
Enter a competition, promotion or survey; or
Give us some feedback.
Automated technologies or interactions. As you use Quidco, we may automatically collect Technical Data
about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies,
server logs and other similar technologies. We may also receive Technical Data and Usage Data about you if
you visit other services employing our cookies.
Third parties or publicly available sources. We may receive personal data about you from various third
parties as set out below:
Technical and Usage Data from the following parties:
Analytics providers such as Google;
Affiliate advertising networks that are involved as intermediaries in the process of
administering your Cashback-generating transactions such as Affiliate Window, Commission Junction
and Performance Horizon; and
Technical monitoring and error reporting service providers that we engage to assist us with our
programme of continuous monitoring and improvement for Quidco Services and the gathering of
information about faults that may occur, such as New Relic and Papertrail.
Contact, Financial and Transaction Data from:
Providers of technical, payment and delivery services for Quidco Services such as Reward
Insight (for Quidco High Street) and CheckoutSmart (for Quidco ClickSnap);
Retailers from which you have made a purchase;
Affiliate advertising networks;
Online businesses which partner with us to provide commercial services to our Account Holders,
such as the comparison service deployed by Quidco Compare, Quidco's gift card mall, and hotel and
other booking services offered through Quidco, (together, Quidco Associates). To be clear: when we
say "Associate" we don't mean that Quidco is in a formal association or partnership with the other
company - our business and the associate's business are entirely separate.
Contact, Marketing and Communications, and Technical Data from businesses through which we carry
out, or which assist us to carry out, marketing campaigns addressed to new or existing Account
Holders, such as (but not limited to) by means of lead generation campaigns, social media marketing,
display advertising and the promotion of the Quidco app.
How do we use your personal data, and what is our legal basis for doing so ?
These are the legal bases we have for holding and processing your personal data:
Contract: To enter into or perform a contract with you
Legitimate Interest: For our (or third parties’) legitimate interests, as long as they
aren’t overridden by your interests and rights
Consent: Your consent
Obligation: To comply with our legal obligations
And here is how we use your personal data, and our relevant legal basis (Our basis) for
doing so:
When you register with us, we obtain your Identity and Contact Data. That Identity and Contact Data may be
supplemented over time with other information, such as Transaction Data, and additional or updated Identity
and Contact Data. We use this information to maintain your registration with Quidco and administer our
relationship with you. Our basis: Contract.
If you enter into a transaction through the Quidco site or app, or provide us with details of a transaction
(such as where you are seeking to obtain Cashback on a Quidco High Street or Quidco ClickSnap purchase), we
may use your Identity, Contact, Financial (Identifier Card) and Transaction Data to track your transaction
and to receive and process Referral Fees. Our basis: Contract and Legitimate Interest (to receive payment of
sums owed to us and you).
We use the Cashback Payout Method you have registered in your Account as part of your Financial Data to
process and distribute Cashback to you. Our basis: Contract
Where a claim or complaint is raised as to Cashback that may be owed, we may use your Identity, Contact,
Financial and Transaction Data, as well as relevant Claims Data, to process that claim or complaint. Our
basis: Contract and Legitimate Interest (to receive payment of sums owed to us and you).
We will also use Identity and Contact Data, Payment Data and Transaction Data to monitor purchases with the
objective of helping to prevent fraud. Our basis: Legitimate Interest (fraud-prevention).
From time to time, you may participate in a survey or provide us with feedback or otherwise engage with us
in ways that, in combination with other data we hold, may be included in your Profile Data. In using the
Quidco (and other) websites and apps, we and our service providers will also collect Technical and Profile
Data. We use and combine Identity, Contact, Profile, Transaction, Financial, Technical, Usage Data and your
Marketing and Communications Data to make our products and services, including the Quidco site and app, and
the offers and marketing you receive, better and more relevant to you, and to enable us to create content
that is more suited to you - and send you more relevant communications. Our basis: Legitimate Interest
(marketing our products and services to you and making our products and services more specific to you),
Consent (where your consent is necessary).
When you engage with a retailer or a Quidco Associate, you may authorise us to communicate your Identity
and Contact Data when you apply to or register with that retailer or Quidco Associate. Our basis:
Consent
You may also consent to a third party - such as a retailer or Quidco Associate - providing us with
Transaction Data concerning your purchase from the retailer or Quidco Associate, which we will combine with
your Identity, Contant and Profile Data, in order to market other goods and services to you. For example,
if you have booked a hotel through a Quidco Associate, we may be provided with details of your stay -
which we may use to market car hire opportunities that we think may interest you. We only do any of this if
you have permitted it by giving your consent to the retailer or Quidco Associate. Our basis: Consent.
We use Contact, Technical and Marketing and Communications Data about you that we receive as a result of
marketing campaigns addressed to new or existing Account Holders to calculate commission due to the
businesses that assist in performing the relevant marketing campaign and help us to analyse your use of
Quidco. Our basis: Legitimate Interest (in the marketing, and understanding the use, of Quidco)
We retain records of our financial transactions and contracts with you in order to maintain adequate
accounting records and meet legal requirements. Our basis: Obligation.
We will use your Marketing and Communications Data and Identity and Contact Data to keep you informed of
important changes to our relationship with you, such as by notifying you of changes to this Privacy Policy.
Our basis: Contract, Obligation and Legitimate Interest (in maintaining a compliant relationship with
you).
We use Customer Service Contact Data, and your Identity and Contact Data, to deal with and investigate
issues you raise with us, to communicate with you about them and (in the case of Customer Service Contact
Data that we pseudonymise for the purpose) to improve Quidco Services. Our basis: Contract; Legitimate
Interest (improving Quidco Services).
We work with online advertising businesses which use small files known as cookies to serve you with
advertising that is thought to be relevant to you, based on your previous browsing habits. Gathered data is
also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and to help measure the effectiveness of
the advertising campaign. Our basis: Legitimate Interest (in providing you with advertising appropriate to
you from third parties).
We will only use your personal data for the above purposes, unless we reasonably consider that we need to
use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your
personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows
us to do so. We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or
permitted by law.
How long will we keep your personal data for?
We keep your personal data for as long as is necessary:
for Our basis as specified in this Privacy Policy, and
to address relevant legal, tax or accounting requirements, including potential claims by and against
us.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of that data, the
purposes for which we process it, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, as well as
legal, taxation and accounting requirements.
You can request more details of how we apply these criteria by contacting our Information Officer by email
at privacy@quidco.com.
When the need to keep your personal data ends, we either delete or anonymise it.
Whom will we share your personal data with?
We will share your personal data with members of our group of companies that provide services to group
members, and to various third parties, but in each case always for the uses referred to above. These third
party businesses are:
Affiliate networks that are involved in the transaction and cashback-allocation process
Payment and transactional service providers
Advertising service providers, such as Google Ad Manager, providing cookie display advertising on
Quidco and on other sites you visit
Businesses through which we carry out, or which assist us to carry out, marketing campaigns
Retailers, listed at https://www.quidco.com/a-z/
Businesses we engage to process data on our behalf, including:
Web- and app-hosting services
Web site optimisation services
Web site usage services
Email service providers
Mobile push notification services
Data management platform providers
Digital gift card distribution services
Customer relationship management services
Marketing tracking partners
Messaging services
Social media platforms
Online and offline marketing services
Research and profiling services
We may also disclose your personal data to HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities who
legally require us to do so.
We may also share your personal data with others where to do so is mandated by applicable law.
Your Marketing and Communications Data will only be shared with a third party for the purpose of them
directly marketing to you where you have consented to that marketing.
If we transfer your personal data outside the United Kingdom to a country that does not
provide a similar level of legal protection to that provided by the United Kingdom’s data protection laws,
we put in place legally appropriate safeguards to require the protection of your personal data. You can
request details of those safeguards by contacting our Information Officer by email at privacy@quidco.com.
If we sell our business or assets, your personal data may be provided to the prospective purchaser’s
advisers with appropriate legal protections and will be passed to the new owners of the business.
How do we keep your data secure?
We have put in place appropriate security measures intended to prevent your personal data from being
accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit
access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a
business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to
a duty of confidentiality.
We have also put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you
and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Your legal rights
Under the law, you have the right to:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access
request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we
are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to
have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the
accuracy of new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove
personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to
ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object
to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are
required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be
in a position to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to
you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate
interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes
you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and
freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct
marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish
the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c)
where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise
or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we
have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide
to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially
provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our Information Officer by email at
privacy@quidco.com. You will not have to pay a fee to exercise any
of your legal rights as specified above. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly
unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these
circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right
to access the relevant personal data (or to exercise any of your other legal rights). This is a security
measure we take to help avoid your personal data being disclosed to a person who has no right to receive
it.
We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to help speed up our
response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a
month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will
notify you and keep you updated.
Cookies
Details of our cookie policy and the cookies used by Quidco are available here.
Password Security
Access to your Account is password-protected for your privacy and security. While we do our best to protect
your personal information you also must protect yourself. What does this mean?
Keep your password or other access information secret.
Ensure no-one else uses Quidco while your machine is "signed in" to the Quidco site or app.
Make sure you sign out from your Account when not using it.
Ensure that only you have access to the details of your cashback Payout method, such as Paypal or
digital gift card, charitable donation, or bank account, which are intended to be kept secret.
Editing your Account and marketing communication settings
We like to keep in touch with our Account Holders so – where we are permitted to do so – we will use your
relevant data to communicate our marketing to you.
Of course we know lots of marketing communications can be annoying, so we try to keep ours to a minimum.
However, if you feel you're getting too many or would like more, you can change the settings in your
Account at any time. We have a one click unsubscribe policy, and each communication gives you the
opportunity to opt-out of receiving similar future communications. You can also review, change or correct
your Identity and Contact Data by signing into your Account and going to the settings tab.
Please note there are some (non-marketing) communications that are an integral part of the Quidco Service
and cannot be opted-out of. These communications cover, amongst other things, changes to the Quidco Service
and your transactions with retailers. They can be brought to an end by de-registering your Account.
Relationship with the Quidco Account Holder Agreement
Words we use in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as in the Quidco Account Holder Agreement.
This Privacy Policy is correct as of 20th January 2020

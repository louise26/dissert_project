Security and Privacy
Book your Hoseasons holiday with confidence! Any personal details you provide will remain private and protected. Here's how...
Why are your card details safe?
Our Secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and is among the best
software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts ALL OF YOUR
PERSONAL INFORMATION, including your credit or debit card number, name and address,
which means that your details cannot be read as the information travels over the
internet. Only Hoseasons can read your personal information.
Equally, as required by the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998, we follow
strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information provided
by our customers.
In the extremely unlikely event that your card details are obtained and used fraudulently,
most banks and credit card providers will either cover all charges resulting from
this unauthorised use of your credit details or will limit your liability to £50.
Please check your card agreement to establish your coverage for liability.
Did you know? The risk of credit card fraud is 100 times greater when you hand your
card to the waiter in a restaurant than when you shop on the Internet! Modern day
encryption technology, used by many websites like ours, virtually eliminates credit
card fraud on the Internet.

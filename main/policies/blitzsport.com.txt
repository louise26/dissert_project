We will not contact you in respect of other services that we offer unless we have obtained your consent to do so. You can stop this consent at any time by giving us notice. We will not disclose any information to any other parties without your consent unless required to do so by law. You are free to withdraw your consent to use your data at any time though this may prevent us from providing you with our services.
The right to access
All of our clients have the right to access the data that we hold.
Most of our customers have access to their data stored in our computer systems through their personal online account and are able to inspect their policy documentation and basic information details.
Your Data can also be provided to you either:

If you do not have access to the necessary computing power to receive documents in this way we can supply your file in paper format.
We will provide this information to you within 30 days of receipt of your request and you are entitled to receive this information free of charge.
PLEASE NOTE that we have the right to refuse or charge for requests that are manifestly unfounded or excessive. If we take this course of action, we will write to you to inform our reasons why. If this should occur and you are unhappy with our decision you may complain to the Information Commissioner as detailed at the end of this notice. You also have the full redress available to you through the court system.
The right to rectification
We will ensure that if you find any errors within the data that we hold we will take immediate steps to rectify them.
The right to erasure
We will ensure that we erase your contact data from all of our systems if requested as long as this does not conflict with the law or our obligations under regulation.
The right to restrict processing
We will only use your data for the procurement of martial arts and other sports equipment and clothing. We will not sell your data or pass it on to any other persons. It could be that we anonymise your data for the purpose of developing new products and services.
If you wish to restrict the use of your data, we will act in accordance with your wishes.
The right to data portability
We will supply your data to other persons or organisations at your request. This will be provided within 14 days of any request and will be supplied in an electronic medium to the email address that you specify.

Cookies
Our website uses cookies. By using our website and agreeing to this policy, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy.
A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.
We use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies on the website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.
We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website; keep track of items in your shopping basket; prevent fraud and increase website security.

We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information.

For example, in Internet Explorer (version 9) you can refuse all cookies by clicking "Tools", "Internet options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block All Cookies" using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

Privacy Explained
Privacy explained
Changes to privacy laws give you more rights and greater protection.
On these pages, we highlight the key points and explain them in simple terms. To do that we've provided short articles that explain some of the issues that affect you, or may be a concern. You'll also find our full Privacy Notice, which includes details of how to contact us about the personal information we hold for you.
Your rights over personal information held by us
This privacy notice sets out how we protect your privacy as required by law. It explains in detail:
what personal information we have and how we get it
how we can and can't use it and
who we can share it with
Read privacy notice
Privacy issues and how they might affect you
What is personal information?
This may seem a simple question, but personal information includes more than you might realise. Discover what the law says.
Data that identifies people as individuals
What personal information do we have?
You have the right to know what data we hold about you. Finding out is easier than you may think - and it's free of charge. See how to get a copy of your data.
Getting a copy of your data
Decisions we make using your data
Machines now make decisions that were once made by people, some with a direct effect on your finances. Learn more about your control over automated decisions.
Your control over automated decisions
What we do to protect your rights
If privacy rules are broken and your personal information is affected, we'll act immediately. Find out what has to happen if there's a breach of privacy laws.
Putting customers first
Asking for your consent - a bigger say for customers
It's often difficult to know what you've consented to. Here we explain about the consents you give and the marketing you can expect to receive.
Marketing you get and consents you give
Data must not be kept longer than needed
Just because you have given a bank your personal information this doesn't mean the bank can hold it forever. Here we explain data retention rules and how your 'right to be forgotten' applies to banks.
Your 'right to be forgotten'

How we work out what marketing you receive
This tells you how we decide what you may be interested in, and what marketing to show or send you.
How we make automated decisions

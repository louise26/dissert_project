Privacy policy
Webgains Personal Data Protection Policy
Personal data are data on the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual natural person (“User”), such as their true name, address, age, e-mail address, telephone number or information on specific preferences, likes etc. On the other hand, information that cannot be associated with User’s genuine identity are not considered personal data: this includes, for example, the number of users of our website or comparable, summarized information. Personal data are protected by the data protection directives and regulations  of the EU and, regarding each Webgains business, by the national regulations of the countries where such business is located (for example in the United States of America, CAN-SPAM Act of 2003).
Webgains observes these regulations and thus respects the individual‘s right of personality and his/her right to protection of privacy. Webgains wants to justify the confidence the users have in its online services and makes the ascertainment, processing and use of personal data transparent for its Users by giving them the following information.
Whilst visiting our website(s), You can visit our website without providing personal information.
As a standard procedure, our web servers temporarily record the connection data of the enquiring computer, which of our websites you visit, the date and duration of the visit, the identification data of the browser and operating system used as well as the website from which you reach us. We may use tracking software to determine the frequency of use and the number of users of our website. This software is not used to collect personal data or IP addresses. The data is used exclusively in anonymous and summarized form for statistical purposes and for the development of the website.No other personal data – such as your name, your address, your telephone number or e-mail address – is collected, unless you provide this information voluntarily, e.g. within the scope of a survey or for the performance of an information enquiry, or by filling a contact form. We also collect further personal data if you conclude a contract with us and register via our website in this respect or in connection with any such contract. The personal data collected in this context can be seen from the registration form that we provide via our website.
Whilst interacting with an advertisement managed by us.
In advertising contacts with the User (e. g. the flashing of marquees on a website) Webgains does not automatically collect or process any personal data. Only non-personal data – such as information on the server via which the User has logged on to the Internet, the browser which is used and if the User clicks on the marquee – all this is recorded anonymously. Webgains collects and processes personal data through various means of advertising (pop-ups, pop-unders, banners). The extent and the kind of data depend on the information which the User enters on a voluntary basis by filling in the respective input fields and transmits to Webgains by sending off this information. Webgains will process and use the personal data on the User which they have collected to fulfil their obligations towards the User, to such an extent which is necessary for this purpose.
If, in collecting, processing and using the Users’ personal data, Webgains pursue any purposes beyond the implementation of the above obligations, this will only be done on the basis of an approval expressly declared by the User, and only to the extent specified in this approval. Such purposes are mainly marketing-oriented and include, among other things, the use of the collected data for market research, the soliciting of customers, sending commercial emails, product information or service development.
In this process, Webgains deploys various techniques to make reasonably sure that the User, and not somebody else, enter the Users’ data and grants Webgains the permission to use them. The User can withdraw his/her consent or part of it at any time, using the same means by which he/she has given this consent (for example, by clicking on the link of the bottom of a commercial email).
Webgains also collects, process and uses personal data on behalf of business partners (e. g. website carriers, advertising customers, agencies), for example for the purpose of generating addresses for a newsletter subscription, product information, orders etc. If any data are collected by Webgains on behalf of any third party, the cooperation partner will be clearly identifiable at any time and is the owner of the collected personal data. In this case, the User can enforce his/her rights exclusively against the cooperation partner of Webgains, as Webgains will act as a simple technical supplier. If Webgains collect any personal data on behalf of any business partners and process and use these data, the business partner shall be responsible for the observance of data protection regulations. In this case, Webgains shall not assume any liability towards the User for the observance of data protection provisions on part of their business partners. No rights or obligations for Webgains shall result from any contracts or non contractual relationships into which the User might enter with a business partner. Webgains cannot exercise any influence on such contracts, neither directly nor indirectly. In this case, Webgains are bound by the instructions of their business partner, however Webgains does not cooperate with such business partners who Webgains  knows to be in breach of data protection regulations.
Cookies
Webgains uses cookies to optimise the use of the Internet for their Users by a reduced repetition of advertising and an increased share of relevant content. For cookies, please see our cookie policy in the “WEBGAINS COOKIES” section below.
Protection
Webgains is bound by law to take the technical and organisational measures which are necessary to guarantee the protection of the personal data, i. e. in particular to protect these data from unauthorized access and unauthorized processing. All data processing programs and facilities have password protection and operate using encoding technology which is present state of the art.
If Webgains use any external server or service provider for the storage of the User data, Webgains will make sure that they are committed to at least the same data protection standard as Webgains themselves. The employees of Webgains are obligated to preserve data secrecy and data protection. This obligation includes, among other things, the fact that the employees may only process and use the personal data to such an extent which is necessary within the scope of contractual or quasi-contractual relationships, or in so far as the User has given his consent to the use of his/her data for the respective purposes. Any personal data which are no longer needed for the fulfilment of contractual obligations by Webgains and/or for the processing and use of which there is no (more) consent from User, will be deleted in such a way that any abuse can be ruled out. In certain cases prescribed by law (e.g. statutory periods of keeping), Users’ data can be archived and/or anonymised instead of being deleted.
If you have any questions about our data protection policy or would like to exercise your right to information, deletion or blocking, please get in touch with our designated data protection contact, Dr Stefan Drewes, at: data-privacy@webgains.com.
Our Data Processing Agreement, which is a requirement for all Merchants wishing to work with Webgains, can be viewed here.
WEBGAINS COOKIES
A HTTP cookie (usually just called a cookie) is a small amount of data sent from us to your web browser. Each time you visit us, your web browser sends us back this text. To find out more about cookies, please visit www.aboutcookies.org
How Webgains uses cookies
As a performance marketing network our job is to ensure that a website (called a publisher) that sends a customer to another website (called an advertiser) is rewarded for a successful referral. A publisher might be a voucher download site, a cashback reward site, a blog or any other website.
This reward process is enabled by using cookies which recognise if you were referred to an advertiser by one of our publishers. Our cookies contain no personally identifiable information.
A large part of the reason why so much is “free” on the internet is because websites can make money through advertising rather than charging you. Being rewarded for referrals is one of the great advances that internet commerce has enabled and we believe is far preferable to forcing people to pay for services.
However, we fully respect your choice as an individual, if you prefer not to enjoy these benefits, we do not want to intrude on your privacy and provide full information on how to delete our cookies.
As well as using cookies for reward purposes, our web site also uses essential and non-essential cookies to remember your preferences, improve your experience on our site and analyse how you use it (full details below).
Essential cookies are required so our web site functions correctly, but you can manage your non-essential cookie preferences at any time here or by clicking on the ‘Cookie management’ link in the footer of any page.

Data Protection Privacy Notices
Privacy Notices
An important aspect of complying with data protection legislation is the requirement to process data fairly and lawfully. In order for the processing to be fair, the University must provide data subjects with accessible information about how their personal data will be used. The most common way to do this is through a privacy notice. A privacy notice is a term used to describe all the privacy information an organisation is obligated to make available to an individual when they are collecting personal data.

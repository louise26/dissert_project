Hello, Guest! A huge thanks to everyone who has submitted their predictions for Last Man Standing so far. This is now OFFICIALLY the LMS with the most entries to date. There is still time to enter, but not long, so if you want to give this incredible caf contest a go and haven't submitted a prediction, this is your last chance. We would love to see you play.Submissions will be open for the next 1 day, 6 minutes, 14 seconds, and will close on Aug 13, 2021 at 20:00.
In the latest episode of the United Hour podcast, Nik, Ed and Raees discuss the Everton pre-season game. There is a tactical analysis of the incoming Varane and the lads stress the importance of a fast league start. There is also an examination of midfield with the chaps wondering who is going to start our first game as they wax lyrical about our attacking riches. Finally, the trio ponder the (eternal?) quest to unearth the ideal CDM, wonder if we can mount a title challenge culminating with a look forward to the Roses rivalry - Leeds! Enjoy the show!

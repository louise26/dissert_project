Purpose of this Privacy Notice
This privacy notice aims to give you information on how WHSmith collects and processes your personal data through your use of this website, including any data you may provide through this website when you shop with us. WH Smith High Street Limited is the data controller and is responsible for your personal data (collectively referred to as "WHSmith", "we", "us" or "our" in this privacy notice).
It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.

How We Use Your Personal Data
We will only use your personal data (name, address, email address, date of birth) when the law allows us to, and only for the purposes agreed to when you provided it. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you, i.e. fulfilling an order.
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data, other than for our own marketing in some situations, and always for third party marketing. In relation to direct marketing communications via email or text message where we collect your consent, you will always be asked to decide how you wish to be contacted. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing (or to object to receiving marketing where we do not rely on consent to send it) at any time by contacting our Customer Services team or by unsubscribing from marketing communications in any e-mail sent to you.

How is Your Personal Data Collected?
We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:
Direct interactions. You may give us your personal information by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, e-mail or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you:
- purchase any of our products or services;
- create an account on our website;
- create an account in the WHSmith Scan & Go application on Google Play or iStore
- join our newsletters programmes or other publications;
- enter a competition, promotion or survey;
- give us some feedback
- interact with our social media channels; or
- engage with our external advertising on third party sites.
Automated technologies or interactions. As you interact with our website, newsletters, or emails we may automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies and other similar technologies.
Third parties or publicly available sources. We may collect technical information about your journey through our site with Google Analytics. We and our authorised partners use this data to improve your site experience.

Your Legal Rights
You have the right to:
Request to access and receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you;
Request any corrections to the personal data that we hold about you;
Request erasure of your personal data;
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground;
Request restriction of processing of your personal data;
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party; or
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your access request is manifestly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request where it is manifestly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

The Data We Collect About You
Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
When you complete an online form, register or shop with us online, register or shop using the Scan & Go application, or engage with us in the ways identified in the ‘How is Your Personal Data Collected?’ section we may collect, use and store different kinds of personal data about you such as your name, gender, date of birth, billing/delivery address, e-mail address and telephone number. We may also collect and retain information about your interactions with us either in store, online, social media, or through our contact centres so that we can process your transactions and deal with any future queries.
We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.
We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.
Back to top
Consent
In certain situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent.
In limited situations, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be aware that it is not a condition of your contract with us that you agree to any request for consent from us.
When collecting your personal data, we'll always make clear to you which data is necessary in connection with a particular contractual or legal requirement.
We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent (for example, in relation to fraud management or to assist with investigations by the police or other regulatory bodies) in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
Back to top
Opting Out
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us or by unsubscribing from marketing communications in any e-mail sent to you.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data by making a 'Request for Erasure'. In order to make such a request, please write to us at support@whsmith.co.uk. Following your request, your personal data shall be removed from our database without undue delay in accordance with statutory requirements.

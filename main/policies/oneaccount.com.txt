Managing our marketing relationships
Our third party marketing partners may set cookies before you reach our site. If you wish to prevent this type of cookie (sometimes known as a âthird partyâ or âanalyticalâ cookie), you may do sothrough your deviceâs browser security settings.
Youâll sometimes see our advertising or special offers on other websites. Cookies provided by the other website or advertising network can tell us how effective this is. For example, if you click on one of our advertisements, the website owner might use a cookie to tell us that you came from their site.
Giving you a better online experience and tracking website performance
Youâll still be able to use most of our online services, but some things might not work as you may expect if you do not allow us to store and access these cookies on your device.
These cookies make our online services easier to use and help us to understand how people use our websites. For example, amongst other things they will:
Make online banking login faster by remembering you between visits on your personal devices
Simplify online transactions by remembering the last account you ised and showing it as the default for your next transaction
Display your mini-statements as you like them by remembering which panels youâve expanded and collapsed
Remember relevant information as you browse from page to page to save you re-entering the same information repeatedly
Here we explain a bit more about each of these types and how you can control their use.
We also use this type of cookie to understand how visitors use our online services and look for ways to improve them. For example, a cookie might tell us that lots of people give up on an application process at a particular step â so we can try to make that step easier to use.

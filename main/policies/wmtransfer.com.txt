Security and privacy
WebMoney Transfer technology is developed taking into consideration
contemporary security requirements to online information management
systems.
Information verification is the key point in provision security to any data
passing through the System.
WebMoney Transfer provides 3 main authentication methods. These are:
Login and password. You can use your WMID, phone number or e-mail specified
during registration as a login. Usually, this method is followed by an
additional confirmation.
Files with secret keys. To launch WM Keeper Classic  you
will need: a unique 12-symbol WM-identifier, password (set by the user),
and files with the secret key and wallets stored in the
computer memory. ATTENTION! You must keep backup copies of keys and
wallets files  on a portable media stored securely! It will significantly
ease recovering access to your
wallet in case if the files at   your PC are lost or
destroyed
Personal
digital certificates.
There are two ways of additional confirmation for transactions:
Sending SMS verification code.
Using E-Num, service for
generating single-use passwords.
System architecture allows secure access to WM-wallets of users
and does not allow making settlements using WM-wallets with
no funds.
Resistibility to connection faults is provided on the system
level. While performing transaction, the funds are always either
on WM-wallet of the sender, or WM-wallet of the receiver. There is
no intermediate state in the system. Thus, it is conceptually
impossible to lose WM-funds.
In addition to embedded technologies, the system supports additional
services which configured by the user.
More details on security methods are available on the website
dedicated to the security of Webmoney Transfer system.
Identification
During registration, a participant of WebMoney Transfer is assigned a
unique number — the 12-symbol WM-identifier (WMID), required to work
in the system.
Verification of the identity of WM-identifier owner within the
system is made by WM-verification.
The system users mey use automated means  for identification
and authentication of the participants at building own applications
(see section
"For
Developers and Web-Masters").
Confidentiality
With the help  of WM Keeper, you can configure display of
personal information (first name, last name, e-mail, postal address,
etc. )  which will be shown to other participants of WebMoney
Transfer. In this case, during transactions, the second party
will receive access the information selected by you only.
If you trade partner asks you to disclose some of the above listed
personal data and you agree with this requirement, then personal
system security settings will allow disclosing this information.
Your WM-identifier cannot be used to learn the numbers of WM-wallets
you are using. If desired, you may install on your computer unlimited
number of WebMoney Keeper version and sign into
the system using different WM-identifiers.

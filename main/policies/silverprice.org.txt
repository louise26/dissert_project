PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
“Personal Information,” means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to any individual or a household. It does not include anonymous or aggregated data that cannot be associated with an individual or household.
We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of Personal Information about you, which we have grouped together as follows:
Identifiers such as your first name, last name, alias, username or similar unique personal identifier, like account name and password if you had an account on the GoldPrice forum.
Contact Information such as your email address.
Profile Data such as user name, password, details of products and services you have received from us in the past, service preferences, feedback and survey responses.
Technical Information such as internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access our Services.
Usage Data includes information about how you use our Services.
Marketing and Communications Information such as marketing campaign data, click throughs, your preferences and consent in receiving marketing from us and your communication preferences.
We may also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your Personal Information but is not considered Personal Information as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.
If You Fail To Provide Personal Information. Where we need to collect Personal Information by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
Information You Provide To A Third Party.  The Services may include links and plug-ins to websites operated by third parties such as links to news sites that we feel may be of interest to you and products and services that may be of interest to you as a user of our Services (“Third-Party Sites”).  GoldPrice does not control any Third-Party Sites and is not responsible for any information they may collect.  The information collection practices of a Third-Party Site are governed by its privacy policy. It is your choice to enter any Third-Party Site.  We recommend that you read its privacy policy if you choose to do so.
Children’s Privacy.  The Services are intended for adult use only and is not directed towards children, minors, or anyone under the age of 18.  If you are under the age of 13, you are not authorized to provide us with any Personal Information.  If the parent or guardian of a child under 13 believes that the child has provided us with any Personal Information, the parent or guardian of that child should contact us at the email address below and ask to have this Personal Information deleted from our files.
HOW WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may collect Personal Information from a variety of sources and methods. This includes:

Information We Collect When You Use Our Services
Automated technologies or interactions.  As is true of most websites, we receive and store certain types of Personal Information whenever you interact with us online. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.  When you access and use our Services from your mobile devices, we receive data from that mobile device.  This may include your device ID, location data, IP address and device type.  You may manage how your mobile device and mobile browser share location information with us, as well as how your mobile browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting your mobile device privacy and security settings.  Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.
Cookies. Cookies are small files that we or our service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser that enables us or our service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.  We use cookies to help us understand how users use the Services. For example, cookies gather information about how long you spend on a web page so that we can understand what web pages are of most interest to users.  If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off cookies by adjusting your browser settings. Please read our Cookie Policy for more information. If you turn off your cookies, some of the features of the Services may not function properly.
Information We Collect From Third Parties
We collect Personal Information from various third parties, including those listed below.  The collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information received from third parties is governed by the privacy policies listed on the website where the information was submitted by the user.  Third parties may send their own cookies and pixel tags to you, and may collect information and use it in a way inconsistent with this Policy.  Please carefully review these third-party privacy policies to understand how your information may be collected, used and disclosed by these third parties.
Third Party Service Providers.  We collect Personal Information from service providers including where we operate accounts on third-party platforms, such as email platforms and social media platforms.
Google Analytics. We use third party cookies provided by Google Analytics to assist us in better understanding our website visitors.  These cookies collect IP address and usage data, such as the length of time a user spends on a page, the pages a user visits, and the websites a user visits before and after visiting our website. Based on this information, Google Analytics compiles data about website traffic and interactions, which we use to offer better user experiences and tools in the future.  For more information on Google Analytics, visit https://support.google.com/analytics.
Third Party Cookies.  We engage third-party service providers to serve ads to you about our products and services as you browse the Internet.  The third-party providers we work with may use their own cookies tags to track your online activities and purchases in order to deliver targeted advertising based on your interests.  Please read our Cookie Policy here.
Your ‘Do Not Track’ Browser Setting. Some web browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature (“DNT”) that signals to the websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. At this time, our websites do not respond to DNT signals.  Other third party websites may keep track of your browsing activities when they provide you with content, which enables them to customize what they present to you on their websites.

HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES
We share your Personal Information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Policy and with our business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors in order to provide you with our Services and perform any contract we enter into with them or you.
Service Providers.  We may use third-party service providers to perform certain business services on behalf of us or the Service, and may disclose Personal Information to such service providers as needed for them to perform these business services.  Service providers are only allowed to use, disclose or retain the Personal Information to provide these services and are prohibited from selling Personal Information.  Business services provided include, but are not limited to, hosting services, software as a service, document management services, communications services such as email, text, and chat services, software and website development services, compliance services, quality control services, analytics services, call center services.
Internal Third Parties. We may share Personal Information with our parent company, subsidiaries and other companies owned by or controlled by Gold Price Group, who may use the Personal Information for the purposes described above.
Business Transactions. We may do business with third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your Personal Information in the same way as set out in this Policy.
Legal Process. Subject to applicable law, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process, such as a subpoena; (ii) in response to requests by government entities, such as law enforcement authorities; (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical, financial or other harm, injury or loss; or (iv) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.
Sales of Personal Information.  Like most companies, we allow certain third party advertising partners to place tracking technology such as cookies and pixels on our websites.  This technology allows these advertising partners to receive information about your activities on our website, which is then associated with your browser or device.  These companies may use this data to serve you more relevant ads as you browse the internet.  Under some state laws, sharing data for online advertising may be considered a “sale” of information.  Except for this limited sharing, we do not sell any of your information.  Gold Price Group has no actual knowledge of any sales of Personal Information of minors under 16 years of age.
For individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom, please see the Section entitled EEA and United Kingdom Privacy Rights in particular the Marketing paragraph of that Section for information relevant to them.
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.
California Consumer Privacy Act. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
Upon verification of your identity you may:
No more than twice in any 12-month period, request disclosure of the following information:
Categories of Personal Information we collect.
Categories of sources from which Personal Information is collected.
Categories of Personal Information sold or disclosed to third parties.
Categories of third parties with whom such Personal Information is sold or disclosed.
Business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling Personal Information.
Specific pieces of Personal Information we collect.
Request deletion of your Personal Information, subject to the exceptions provided by law.
Opt-out from having your Personal Information sold to third parties, if applicable.
Requests can be submitted by calling our toll free number 1-888-514-0189 or emailing us at privacy@goldprice.org.  You can opt out of having your Personal Information sole to third parties by clicking on the “Do Not Sell My Info” link on our website.
Please note that these rights apply only to select California consumers and exclude job applicants, employees, and business contacts.  Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.  Except where you have provided an agent with a Power of Attorney pursuant to Sections 4000 – 4465 of the California Probate Code, when using an authorized agent you must: (1) provide the agent with signed permission clearly describing their authority to make a request on your behalf; (ii) verify your own identity; and (iii) directly confirm that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.  That agent must also be able to verify their identity with us and provide us with their authority to act on your behalf.
The verifiable consumer request initiated by you or your authorized agent must:
Include your full legal name, email, and phone number, which we will need to contact you in order to verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.  Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.  One of our representatives will contact you in order to verify your identity.  You may need to provide additional information in order to verify your request, such as [INSERT].  Depending on the nature of the request, we may require additional verification actions be taken, including but not limited to providing a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose Personal Data is the subject of the request.  We will only use this information to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
The CCPA provides the right to be free from discrimination if you choose to exercise your rights under the statute, and we will not discriminate by:
Denying you goods or services.
Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Providing you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
Other California Privacy Rights.  California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents who have provided personally identifiable information to us or our third-party advertisers and marketing partners, if any, to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.  You may obtain this information once a year and free of charge by contacting us at the address below.
EEA AND UNITED KINGDOM PRIVACY RIGHTS
This Section is relevant to you if you are located in the EEA or in the United Kingdom.  In so far as this Section is inconsistent with or conflicts with any other part of this Policy the terms of this Section will apply if you are located in the EEA or in the United Kingdom.  This Section does not apply if you are not located in the EEA or in the United Kingdom.
Marketing
Marketing. We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain Personal Information uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
Promotional offers from us. We may use your Identifiers, Employment and Contact Information and, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
Third-party marketing. We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your Personal Information with any third party for marketing purposes.
Opting out. You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.
Where you opt out of receiving marketing messages, this will not apply to emails of a non-promotional nature and which relate to a product/service subscribed for, product/service experience or other transactions.
Change of Purpose
We will only use your Personal Information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your Personal Information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your Personal Information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
International Transfers
Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA and the United Kingdom so their processing of your Personal Information will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your Personal Information to a third party that is based outside the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented.
We will only transfer your Personal Information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Information by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission that give Personal Information the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Information shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Information out of the EEA.
How Long Will You Use My Personal Data For?
We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your Personal Information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
Summary of Your Legal Rights and How to Exercise Them
Each of us is a joint controller with J M Bullion, Inc., our parent entity, and J M Bullion, Inc. is also responsible for your Personal Information. This means that J M Bullion, Inc. jointly determines with each of us the means and purposes of processing Personal Information for the purposes of our respective businesses.

LEGAL RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE EEA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM
You have the right to:
Request access to your Personal Information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information data unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your data which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
You have objected to our use of your Personal Information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

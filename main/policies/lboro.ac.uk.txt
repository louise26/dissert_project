Freedom of Information
Loughborough University, along with thousands of other Public Authorities must comply with the Freedom of Information Act. The Act was created as an initiative to increase openness and transparency in Government, with the FOI Act passed on 30 November 2000.
The Act obliges organisations covered by it to make information available to members of the public, through a publication scheme and, additionally, to make any other information (with a number of statutory exceptions) available upon request.

How we protect your personal data
section closed
We have put various measures in place to protect your personal data:
We are independently certified to a number of industry recognised standards, including ISO27001 which helps us maintain the highest levels of security across our entire business.
We are a founding member of the World Lottery Association (WLA) and therefore comply with, and are regularly audited on, the WLA Security Control Standards for our gaming processes.
Our online security controls maintain confidentiality at all times, specifically for secure card payments. We are certified to the payment card data security standards (PCI-DSS) and never store card details.
Our entire site is accessed using https rather than http, meaning that all information that is sent and received is encrypted for additional security. You can see this in the address bar of your browser.
As described in this Privacy Policy, we may in some instances disclose your personal data to third parties. Where we do, we require that third party to have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to protect your personal data; however in some instances we may be compelled by law to disclose your personal data to a third party, and have limited control over how it is protected by that party.
Our website and app are regularly audited by an independent auditor to ensure we maintain our security accreditations.
Your personal data may be processed outside the UK or European Economic Area (EEA) – including by staff operating outside the UK or EEA who work for us or for one of our third parties mentioned.

Where your personal data is transferred outside of the UK or EEA, we require that appropriate safeguards are in place. To find out more about the appropriate safeguards that we have in place, please contact us.
How long we keep your personal data
section closed
We will only keep your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
At the end of that retention period, your data will either be deleted or anonymised (so that it can no longer be associated with you) and used for research or statistical purposes.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances you may be entitled to ask us to delete your data: see ‘Your rights’ below for further information.

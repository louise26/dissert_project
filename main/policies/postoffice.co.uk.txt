Privacy policy
Your privacy’s very important to you. Rest assured it’s as important to us.
Privacy policy explained
Need help?
Coronavirus update | Information requests during COVID-19
If you need to request your personal data, the best way to reach us right now is email information.rights@postoffice.co.uk.
Like many other businesses, the coronavirus pandemic has severely challenged our ability to ensure our administrative centres operate normally as a result of travel restrictions and reduced resources.
So we’re unlikely to be able to respond promptly to customer requests for information sent by post.
There’s more on how Post Office uses your information and your rights in our privacy policy below.
How and why we use your personal information
A provider you can trust
Post Office is the UK’s largest retail network and largest financial services chain. We’ve more branches than all banks and building societies put together.
That’s a reach and responsibility we take very seriously. We’re committed to protecting any personal details we hold about you, being clear how and why they’re used, and respecting your privacy in everything we do.
Our privacy policy sets out:
What data we may collect about you
How we use it
Information about your rights
How you can get in touch with us
The policy covers:
Other ways we may use your data to help improve what we do
Using our main website
How we manage our direct marketing activities
What happens when you contact our customer care teams
Other ways we may use your data to help improve what we do
Please note
Our different products and services have additional policies. You’ll find links to them below.
If our privacy policy changes, we’ll always publish the updates here, to view any time.

About Post Office
Post Office Limited and Post Office Management Services Limited are registered in England and Wales. You’ll find full company information  here.
Contacting us about your data
You can request any personal details we hold about you any time from:
Email
data.protection@postoffice.co.uk
Mail
Post Office Data Protection Officer, Finsbury Dials, 20 Finsbury Street, London, EC2Y 9AQ
For more on our privacy practices and your rights, contact our Information Rights Team:
Email
information.rights@postoffice.co.uk
Mail
Post Office Information Rights Team, Finsbury Dials, 20 Finsbury Street, London EC2Y 9AQ
What information we collect about you
When you submit an online form, request a quote or buy a product or service from Post Office or our partners, we collect your name and contact details. These could include your email, postal address and phone number.
We may also collect opinions or other data you’ve shared in forms, surveys, correspondence with our customer care teams and on phone calls.
If you apply for and use Post Office products and services, we’ll gather data to help you benefit from them. See the links to our product-specific privacy policies for how.
When you visit this website, we record your IP address, when you visited, which pages you looked at, plus information about your device, operating system and browser. This data is gathered using commonly used tools such as cookies and web beacons.
To enrich the data about you in our database, we compare it with external sources. This helps us tailor our communications with you and offer only products and services you may be interested in (if you’ve chosen to receive marketing).
It also informs us of some changes, such as when email addresses are no longer valid or mail has been returned, so we can stop sending marketing.
Why we collect and what we do with personal data
There are lots of reasons we collect your personal details. Here are the most common.
Our obligation to provide Post Office products and services (‘performance of a contract’)
Personal details enable us to provide the products or services you buy from us. Please check the individual privacy policies for these products using the links provided below.
If you give your permission (‘Consent’)
We’ll contact you about offers and deals we think will be of interest in only the ways you let us. To change these permissions at any time, you can:
Complete a contact form
Call 03457 22 33 44
Email pol_marketpermissions@response-service.co.uk
Write to Marketing Preference Team, Finsbury Dials, 20 Finsbury Street, London, EC2Y 9AQ
If we have a justifiable reason (‘legitimate interests’)
These reasons can include:
To enhance or improve your experience with us. This may mean learning your habits and preferences then tailoring our communications so they’re relevant to you (‘profiling’)
To combine your information with other customers’ data and external non-personal details so we better understand our market through analysis and segmentation, to keep offering competitive products and services and improve our website
To send you marketing materials where we can demonstrate a relationship with you and you’ve not told us you don’t want to receive these
To maintain our list of people who’ve asked not to receive our direct marketing material
To help keep our website safe and secure
To help prevent fraud and maintain security
To allow our internal business processes to function – like transacting with our partners, carrying out audits, producing management information and dealing with complaints
To do market research
To request feedback on our performance
To assist in training, quality assurance and compliance
If we have to do something by law (‘legal obligation’)
To ensure your rights are met under the UK Data Protection Act
To meet our obligations with law enforcement agencies, courts and other organisations
To comply with anti-money laundering regulations
In exceptional circumstances (‘vital interests’)
We may use your information in rare situations to protect your vital interests or those of others. For example, to trace a missing person or if someone’s life could be in danger.
Who we share your information with
We do not sell your information to anyone. And we only pass it on to these trusted partners, service partners and regulators:
Service providers that work for us, such as marketing agencies and survey sites, website hosts, printers and, in some cases, our postmasters and retail agency partners
Our subsidiary companies who work for us in providing services
Regulatory bodies, courts and law enforcement agencies
Partner companies that supply products or services, or for queries or complaints
See the links to individual privacy policies below for more product-specific details.
How long we keep personal data for
The time we keep personal information for depends on why we have it and how we use it:
We keep records of your dealings with us or our partners for up to six years after the last contact, to respond to any complaints or disputes if they arise
We’ll keep other personal information about you if it’s necessary to comply with the law
Data collected when you use our website, like your IP address, is deleted after 28 days
Please check our product-specific privacy policies for further details. You’ll find links below.
Transferring information outside of the EEA
Your personal information may be processed outside the European Economic Area (EEA) where privacy laws may not provide protection to the same level as in the UK.
Before any transfer takes place, we’ll take steps to make sure your personal information will be adequately protected, as required by the UK Data Protection Act, with safeguards such as standard contractual clauses are in place. For more information, please see the individual product or service privacy policies below or contact us.
When you use this website, transact in our branches or submit queries, your information can be viewed by service providers in India and the Philippines who run the platform on our behalf. Contracts are in place (known as an ‘EU Model Clause’) to allow the data to be transferred and managed securely, to the standards required by the UK Data Protection Act.
Your rights and choices
You’re in control of the data we hold about you and how we use it.

Deletion (‘Right to be Forgotten’): In some circumstances, including where we’re relying on your consent to use your data, you have a right to ask us to delete your information
‘Right to Portability’: If we’ve collected your data because you’ve given us consent, or because we need it to provide you with a product or service (under a contract), you have the right to get the information you gave back in a ‘machine-readable’ format
‘Right to Object’ and ‘Right to restriction of processing’: If we’re using your data for activities under the ‘legitimate interest’ justification and in other circumstances, you have the right to request restriction of processing and to object to that processing
Right to obtain human intervention: Where automated processing has taken place, where consent has been given or under a contract, and where the processing has a legal or similarly significant effect
Complain: If you think our use of your information doesn’t meet the law, you’ve the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)
Contact us
For more information or to request any of these rights, please contact:
Email: information.rights@postoffice.co.uk
Mail: Post Office Information Rights Team, Finsbury Dials, 20 Finsbury Street, London EC2Y 9AQ
Keeping personal information secure
We take the security of your personal information seriously and will take all reasonable and proportionate steps to protect it.
To safeguard all personal details under our control – both on and offline – from improper access, use, alteration, destruction and loss, we’ve put technology and security policies, rules and measures in place.

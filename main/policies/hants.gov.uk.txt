When we provide services we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, we sometimes place small files on your device to help us achieve these goals. These files are commonly known as cookies.
Cookies help to improve your experience on the site but can't be used to identify you personally.
Cookies can:
enable a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to give the same information several times during one task
recognise that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested
measure how many people are using our services so they can be improved
We have split our cookies into three groups.

What are cookies?
Cookies and similar tracking technologies, such as tags, scripts and beacons, are small pieces of code (referred to
as cookies hereafter) that are stored on a device (computer, mobile phone, tablet etc) and enable a website to
"personalise" itself to users by remembering information about the user's visit to the website. We also use cookies
within emails we may send.
Cookies are used to collect information, where available, about your device, your IP address, operating system and
browser type and how you have interacted with our websites.
While cookies are used to identify users and devices, they only ever collect non-personal information such as IP
addresses, device IDs. If the data cookies collect are ever merged with any other information with which you have
provided us, such as email addresses, these are anonymised in such a way that identification to actual people is
impossible.
Why do we use them?
Our websites use cookies to:
Store any preferences you have made and display content to you in a more personalised way
Evaluate our websites' advertising and promotional effectiveness
Gain insight into the nature of our audience so we can tailor our content accordingly
Provide interest-based advertising on our websites and on other websites which are tailored to your interests
and preferences
We have a legitimate interest to use cookies so that we can show you adverts we believe you might be interested in,
to control the number of times you see an advert and to measure the effectiveness of a campaign. We advertise on our
site and in our newsletters to help keep the content free for our audiences.
We will always make sure our websites contain clear and easy to find information about our cookies.
What types of cookies do we use?
Per-session cookies - We only use these while you are visiting our website and they are deleted when you leave.
They remember you as you move between pages, for example recording the items you add to an online shopping
basket. They also help maintain security.
Persistent cookies - These cookies stay on your computer until they expire or are deleted. We set automatic
deletion dates so that we don't keep your information for longer than we need to.
First and third-party cookies – Whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the website or domain
placing the cookie. First party cookies in basic terms are cookies set by a website visited by the user - the
website displayed in the URL window. Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one
being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and a separate company sets a cookie through that website
this would be a third-party cookie.
Below is a non-exhaustive list of the different third-party cookies that we use:

Why we use your personal information
The PPL payment solutions, catering systems and communication platforms (“PPL Products and Services”), which are marketed in the UK under the ParentPay, Schoolcomms and Cypad brands, are provided to schools and their parents governed by a contract between us and the schools, Multi-Academy Trust or a Local Education Authority (“ParentPay Customer”), and also the Terms and Conditions that you agree with when you sign up (“ParentPay User”).
We process your personal data for the following purposes:
to provide you with the service activated and registered for
the verification of your identity where required
for the prevention and detection of crime, fraud and anti-money laundering
for the ongoing administration of the service
to allow us to improve the products and services we offer to our customers
to ask for your opinion about our products and offer surveys
for research and statistical analysis including payment and usage patterns
We only use the data in an anonymized manner when we use your data for this purpose.
to enable us to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations
to offer new products and services to you which are relevant and appropriate, and only to the extent that would be reasonably expected.
If we plan to introduce further processes for the use of your information, we will provide information about that purpose prior to such processing.
The legal basis for processing
Under Data Protection Law, there are various grounds which are considered to be a ‘legal basis for processing’.
The legal basis for processing should be determined by the Data Controller.
Where we are the Data Processor, the legal basis is determined by the Customer. Typically, the legal basis in this scenario is:
‘processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest’
and/or
‘processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller’
Where we are the Data Controller, the legal basis for processing is based on:
‘processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller’
It should be noted that in some circumstances this legal basis may vary, however, we always operate in full compliance with Data Protection Law and will only process data with a fair and reasonable legal basis for doing so.

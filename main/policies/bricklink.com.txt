We may combine this information with other personal data we collect from you (and our service providers may do so on our behalf).Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping, analytic, and advertising purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our website and apps, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our website and apps.Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our online channels and apps who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the online channels and apps, but some features may not function.Both we and our service providers use browser storage, app storage, cookies, pixels, beacons, scripts and tags to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement through the site and collect demographic information about our overall user base. We may receive reports on these from our service providers on an individual and aggregate basis. For more information about cookies, please read our full Cookie Policy.Analytics. We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our websites and apps. We use these tools to help us improve the performance of our websites and apps and our users’ experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage objects (LSOs), to perform their services. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.Do-Not-Track. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Ad Network section.Ad NetworksWe use network advertisers to serve advertisements on our website and on non-affiliated websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these network advertisers to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These cookies and other technologies are governed by each entity's specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these advertisers with information, including personal data, about you.As noted above, we disclose certain information (such as your email address) to Google (to opt-out of Google Analytics Audiences and other Google advertising, go here)—so that we can better target ads and content to you and others with similar interests on non-affiliated websites or media (“Custom Audiences”). We may also work with other ad networks and marketing platforms that enable us and other participants to target ads to Custom Audiences submitted by us and others. You may also control how Google and other entities display certain ads to you, as explained further in their respective privacy policies or by using the opt-outs described below.Users may opt out of many ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by NAI members. If you are in the European Union, you may opt out of certain third-party cookies that we and other websites may use for targeted advertising through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Your Online Choices Page or www.aboutads.info.Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companies' delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our website, apps, or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA's website at www.aboutads.info or the NAI's website at www.networkadvertising.org.Data security and integrityThe security, integrity and confidentiality of customer information is extremely important to us.

Additional information about our privacy practices with respect to our collection and use of information from Events may be found in additional privacy statements on the registration sites for Events hosted by us.
How We Share Information Collected
We may disclose personal information that you provide to us to the following categories of recipients:
To our subsidiaries and affiliates (including those located outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland) who will use it only for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.
To our contractors, business partners and service providers we use to support our business or who provide services on our behalf. For clarity, ServiceNow does not share Event attendee data with business partners or sponsors unless you opt in to such sharing via an Event registration form or you attend an Event hosted by ServiceNow and allow our business partners or sponsors to scan your attendee badge. If you do not wish for your information to be shared with our business partners or sponsors, you may choose not to opt in via the event registration forms and elect not to have your badge scanned by a partner at an Event. If you choose to share your information with business partners or sponsors, your information will be subject to the respective business partner or sponsor’s privacy statement.
To a potential buyer (and its agents and advisors) in connection with any proposed merger, acquisition, or any form of sale or transfer of some or all of our assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation), in which case personal information held by us about you will be among the assets transferred to the buyer or acquirer.
To any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party to: (i) comply with any court order, a request from any competent law enforcement agency, or any other legal obligation; (ii) enforce or apply our Website Terms of Use or terms of any other agreement; (iii) and protect the rights, property, or safety of ServiceNow or others.
To any other person with your consent to the disclosure.
We do not sell, rent or trade information collected through the Website with third parties for their promotional purposes.
Legal Basis for Processing
If you are from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided in the "Contact Information” section below.
International Transfer of Data
ServiceNow stores and processes any information collected in connection with the Website or an Event in: (i) any country where we have facilities, (ii) any country in which we engage service providers; or (iii) any country where Events are held. A list of ServiceNow’s global offices is available here.
If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area ("EEA"), we will protect your personal information when it is transferred outside of the EEA by:
Processing it in a territory which the European Commission has determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal information; or
Otherwise implementing appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, including through the use of Standard Contractual Clauses or another lawful transfer mechanism approved by the European Commission.
If you require further information about our international transfers of personal information, please contact us using the contract details in the “Contact Information” section further below.
Security and Confidentiality
ServiceNow maintains appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information obtained through the Website and in connection with Events from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure and access. ServiceNow personnel and service providers with access to personal information collected through our Websites or from Event attendees are required to keep such information confidential and secure.
Retention
We will retain your personal information if we have a business need to do so or for as long as is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement, unless a longer retention period is required by law (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Your Privacy Rights
We provide you with certain choices regarding the information you provide to us. In particular:
If you wish to access, correct, update, or request deletion of your personal information, you can send us an e‑mail at privacy@servicenow.com. Event registrants and attendees may update their user profiles for Events we host by logging into the applicable event website or registration page.
Certain jurisdictions, for example the European Economic Area, provide their residents specific privacy rights under applicable law. We will process your requests to exercise such rights, including if you object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information, in accordance with applicable data protection laws. You may send us an e‑mail at privacy@servicenow.com or using the contact details under the “Contact Us” heading below.
If you do not wish to receive our email marketing communication for promotional purposes, you may opt‑out by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt‑out” link in the marketing e‑mails we send you. To opt‑out of other forms of marketing (such as telemarketing), please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Information” section below.
In addition, if we process your personal information in reliance upon your consent, you can contact us at any time to withdraw your consent.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority if you are unhappy about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and certain non‑European countries (including the US and Canada) are available here.
We will respond to such requests in accordance with the requirements of applicable data protection laws. Please note that in order to fulfil your request, we may need you to provide certain information to verify your identity.
General
Do Not Track
While ServiceNow attempts to honor do not track (“DNT”) instructions we receive from a Visitor’s browser, we cannot guarantee that ServiceNow will always respond to such signals, in part, because of the lack of common industry standard for DNT technology. We continue to monitor developments in DNT technology and stay apprised of DNT industry standards as they evolve.
Third Party Websites and Applications
This Website may link to websites that are not owned or controlled by ServiceNow. As such, this Privacy Statement does not apply to information collected on any third‑party site or by any third‑party application that may link to or be accessible from the Website. This Privacy Statement does not apply to information collected by customers, our business partners, and other third parties or third‑party applications or services, even if this information is collected using our Website or at Events.
Public Forums and Blogs
Please note that any information you post or disclose in public forums will become public information, and may be available to users and the general public. We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose your personal information, or any other information in our public forums. Proper access and use of information provided on the Website, including contributions to our public forums, is governed by our Website Terms of Use and known or suspected violations should be reported to our Privacy team via e‑mail at privacy@servicenow.com.

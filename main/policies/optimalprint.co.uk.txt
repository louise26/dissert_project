PRIVACY POLICY
The Optimalprint Service is provided by Gelato AS, who is committed to
protecting the personal data of those individuals who visit our websites
and register to use our products and services. This policy describes our
data protection practices and how we use and collect the Personal Data that
you share with us when browsing our Websites and/or registering for our
products. Our processing of your Personal Data is needed for us to deliver
the service to you. We may also process your Personal Data in order to
comply with our legal obligations as explained below or due to our
legitimate interests.
1. PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT
We will collect Personal Data from you in the following circumstances:
When you create an account and
place an Order:
We will collect your first and last name, E-mail address, postal address,
phone number, password, payment information, such as
your credit card or PayPal account information, drafts of product designs
that you save under your Account, content that you choose to save under
your Account, communications and correspondence sent to and from your
Account, information about purchasing habits and preferences, order
histories, and/or Account histories.
When you create or design Products:
We may collect any images, text, logos or other content that you upload or
submit, including information related to or included within such content,
such as the names, birthdates, ages and gender of individuals to whom the
content is related.
When interacting with Social media sites:
You may be able to register and create an Account to use the Services using
your Facebook, Google or other social media accounts. If you choose to use
this option, where available, we will access your social media account
profile information, such as your name and e-mail address.
The Services may give you the option to upload a photo from your social
media account, such as Facebook and Instagram, and from your account with
cloud storage services, such as Google Photos. If you choose to use this
functionality, we will access your social media account profile
information, including your profile photo and all photos that you have
saved within your social media account.
You can stop sharing your social media account profile information with us
at any time by removing Gelato‚Äôs access to that account. Any information
that we collect from your Facebook or other social media account may depend
on the privacy settings you have with that social media, so please consult
the social media‚Äôs own privacy and data practices.
2. PURPOSE AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA
We use your Personal Data, including your Content, for the following
purposes:
¬∑ To provide you with the services and to evaluate, modify and enhance the
services
¬∑ To enable you to set up your account, to create and design Products,
process and fulfill your order
¬∑ To process your payment, facilitate billing and issue invoices, as
applicable
¬∑ To communicate with you and to respond to your requests
¬∑ To provide you with customer service and support
For corporate account management purposes
¬∑ To help keep our website safe and secure and to improve the website
We use Automatic Information to analyze trends, administer the Website and
track user activities on the Website if you have consented to this in the
Cookie Policy.
We will create anonymous data records from Personal Data by excluding
information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable
to you. We use such Anonymous Data records to analyze request and usage
patterns so that we may enhance the content of the Services and improve
Website navigation.
3. HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We disclose your Personal Data as described below. Personal Data provided
by you or that we may obtain automatically by your use of the Website, is
not and will not be sold, rented, or shared by us with any third party
without your prior consent.
Transfer and Storage of Personal Data
Your Personal Data will be transmitted, uploaded, transferred, stored, or
backed up at Gelato‚Äôs servers with our GDPR compliant cloud providers in
the United States and Europe.
Third Party Service Providers
We will share your Personal Data with third party companies and individuals
that perform Services on our behalf to help us provide the Website and
Services to you. In Order to fulfill your print Order in the most
environmentally friendly way, we let the printer closest to the address of
delivery print your products. This may mean a transfer of your personal
data out of EU. Other examples of Services that may be provided by Third
Party Service Providers may include, but are not limited to: processing
credit card payments with our payment provider in EU, providing customer
service by our suppliers in EU and the Philippines, and maintaining our
customer lists by our service providers in EU. Third Party Service
Providers acting on our behalf are only provided with such Personal Data
reasonably required to provide the particular service for which they are
retained. Our Third-Party Service Providers are obligated to keep all of
your Personal Data confidential and to collect, use and disclose your
Personal Data only to the extent necessary to provide the Services on our
behalf. They are fully compliant to the EU GDPR regulation and have signed
a Data Processing Agreement with Gelato.
Advertisers and Third-Party Marketing
From time to time, we may share your Personal Data in a way so that it is
only readable by the intended advertiser to be able to serve you relevant
information and marketing messages on that advertising platform. We may
also share aggregated demographic information and/or customer ID numbers
with our partners and advertisers. This is based on your consent to the
Cookie Policy. We do not sell Personal Data to third parties for their
own marketing purposes.
Third Party Payment Processor
For online payments, we use the payment services of Adyen B.V. Gelato does
not process, record or maintain your credit card or bank account
information. Gelato records the payment method you have chosen. For
Optimalprint Premium members, for Native app customers and customers who
prefer, Adyen will store the applicable payment data provided by you in
order to charge the periodic fee. This is also optional for all
Optimalprint customers.
Business Transfers
We may share some or all of your Personal Data in connection with or during
negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution,
transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or
disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of
an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Data may also be
transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company,
business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Data that we
have collected and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your
Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy. The company may need
your consent to continue handling your data.
Compliance with Law, Court Order, and Other Disclosures
You hereby acknowledge and agree that Gelato may, in its sole discretion,
release Account and other Personal Data when we believe such release is
appropriate: (a) to comply with an applicable law, statute, regulation,
Court order, or administrative proceeding; (b) in connection with any legal
investigation; (c) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or
potential violation of this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use; or (d) to
protect the rights, property, or safety of Gelato, our users, or others.
This may include exchanging information with other companies and
organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Third Party Sites
The Website may contain links to third party websites, or third party
websites may otherwise be associated with the Website. These companies are
GDPR compliant and Gelato has signed a Data Processing Agreement with them.
Gelato is not responsible for the policies and practices employed by the
owners of such third party websites, including but not limited to their
collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data, nor does Gelato offer
any (and expressly disclaims any) guarantee, representation, warranty, or
covenant of any kind with respect to the collection, use or disclosure of
your Personal Data by any third party site that is linked from (or is
otherwise associated with) the Website. Please consult the terms and
conditions and privacy policies of any third party websites prior to use.
Security of Your Personal Data
We employ security safeguards to protect your Personal Data against loss or
theft, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or
modification. When we transmit highly confidential information over the
Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption technology, such as
the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. We also protect your stored
password through the use of encryption technology.

How we share your personal data
We do not sell your personal data to other organisations. We may have to share your personal data for the purposes set out in this privacy policy with the following.Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
Where we store your personal data
We share your personal data within the CIPD Group. In general the personal data that we collect from you will be stored at a destination within the UK or European Economic Area (EEA). However we may also transfer your data outside the EEA.Please note that some countries outside of the EEA have a lower standard or protection for personal data, including lower security requirements and fewer rights for individuals. Where your personal data is transferred, stored and/or otherwise processed outside the EEA, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this policy.Unfortunately, no transmission of your personal data over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Data security
We take care to ensure the security of your personal data in use, storage and transmission and that it is only accessed by verified persons who have the necessary authority. All of our people who have access to your personal data are obliged to respect the confidentiality of this information and we deliver training to make sure this happens.Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Data retention
HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.In general, unless still required in connection with the purpose(s) for which it was collected and/or is processed, we remove your personal data from our records seven years after the date it was collected unless different retention periods apply, for example we will keep member data for 15 years after membership expiry in order to comply with requests for verification of membership status that are made to us. However, if before that date (i) your personal data is no longer required in connection with such purpose(s), (ii) we are no longer lawfully entitled to process it or (iii) you validly exercise your right of erasure, we will remove or anonymise your personal data from our records at the relevant time.Where we anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) we may use this information for research or statistical purposes indefinitely without further notice to you.If you request to receive no further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to comply with your request and avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future.
International transfers
From 1 January 2021, the UK is a ‘third country’ for EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) purposes.International transfers must be given additional safeguards. This is on top of the existing measures we have in place for international transfers outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).Data transfers from the CIPD to EEA countriesWe can still send personal data to the EU/EEA, Gibraltar and other countries deemed “adequate” by the EU. They have adequate protection by the UK Government under the new arrangements. We will always do so securely in accordance with the GDPR principles.Data transfers to the CIPD from EEA countriesBecause the UK is currently deemed a ‘third country’, the EU require additional protection when transferring personal data to the UK.We use the Standard Contractual Clauses to make sure that data transfers are secure and lawful. These are EU approved terms to facilitate the continued exchange of personal data.This is the most appropriate safeguarding available to the CIPD and ensures that we continue to protect personal data flowing into the UK from the EEA. These will be in place after a 4-6 month extension granted by the EU at the start of 2021.Data transfers from the CIPD to countries outside the EEA (including Singapore and United Arab Emirates)The CIPD is an international organisation with offices located outside the EEA. We may share your personal data within the CIPD Group. If applicable this will involve transferring your data outside the UK. In addition, some of our applications, services and products use service providers outside of the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK. We may have to transfer some of your data to these providers so you can use our website and products.Appropriate measures and controls (including technical) are in place to protect the transfer of your data.Transfer of data is made in accordance with the requirements of Regulations (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) and may be based on the use of the European Commission’s Standard Model Clauses for transfers of personal data outside the EEA.By using our websites, products or by interacting with us in the ways described in this privacy notice, you consent to the transfer of your data outside the EEA in the circumstances set out in this privacy notice.If you do not want your data to be transferred outside the EEA you should not use our website or products or services. We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
Keeping you in control of your personal data
How to control what we send youIf you would like to unsubscribe from the CIPD newsletter or update your preferences of how and what we communicate to you at any time, please visit our marketing preference centre at www.cipd.co.uk/myprofile/communicationpreferences to select your preferences. You can also click on the 'unsubscribe' button at the bottom of the email newsletter. It may take up to 72 hours for this to take place.Your legal rightsWe want to ensure that you remain in control of your personal data. You can contact our customer services team at any time by email (dataprotection@cipd.co.uk) or telephone (+44 (0)208 612 6208) if you wish to exercise any of your rights. Please provide your full name, membership number (if applicable), contact telephone number and email address.You have the right to:Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it subject to any exceptions that apply.To assist us in processing your request, you will need to provide details of the information sought. Please describe, in as much detail as possible, the information you wish to have access to and if appropriate, any dates relevant to the information sought.Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. If you believe our records of your personal data are inaccurate you can ask us to update these records, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.If you have an online account with us, you can update your personal data and marketing preferences by making amendments in the 'My Profile' section of our website.Request erasure of your personal data. You can ask us to delete personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your erasure request for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request or as soon as possible thereafter. We may also anonymise your data rather than delete it.Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.Request restriction of processing of your personal data. You can ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.If you would like to opt out from receiving marketing messages from us, please see section above on OPTING OUT.WHAT WE WILL NEED FROM YOUWe will need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.TIME LIMIT TO RESPONDWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.THIRD-PARTY LINKSOur websites may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements.

Global Cookie Policy
November 2019
Introduction
Like most websites, the Dyson websites use cookies. “Cookies” are small text files that websites save onto your device via your web browser. They’ve been around since the mid-1990’s and are one of the most widely used technologies on the internet. Many essential website functions rely on cookies. For example, you can't shop online without them as they are used to remember what you add to your shopping basket.
Some cookies that we use at Dyson will collect personal data about you. Any personal data that is collected will be used in accordance with our privacy policy. Cookies are there to allow our websites to work, and to help us understand what information is most useful to visitors of our websites.
Cookie principles
This cookie policy describes how Dyson uses cookies on all of its websites around the world. In this cookie policy, when we refer to "Dyson", "us", "we" or "our", we mean the Dyson group company or companies which provide the particular website to you.
Your acknowledgement
By continuing to use our websites, you accept that cookies will be set on your device, as outlined in this cookie policy.

How we use cookies

Many cookies on our websites perform essential functions and enable you to move around our websites and use their features; for example, when you log in to your Dyson account, they remember the information in your account. We refer to these cookies in this policy as "Strictly Necessary Cookies".
Other cookies are not essential but they help us understand how our websites are used by visitors, so that we can improve what we do online. We use Web Analytics tools for this. They look at things like how long our websites take to load, how they are used, and what information visitors to our sites look at most. This helps us to improve the way our websites work, for example, by ensuring that you find what you are looking for easily. They also help identify any parts of our websites that aren't working as well as they should - so we can fix things and make our websites better for you and other users. We refer to these cookies in this policy as "Analytics Cookies".
Additional cookies allow our websites to recognise you when you return to our websites. This enable us to remember choices that you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. We refer to these cookies in this policy as "Functional Cookies".
A further type of cookie lets us know how well our online advertising works, and where we should place our online advertisements. These cookies let us know if one of our advertisements on another website like Google or Yahoo has sent a visitor to a Dyson website.
This type of cookie also helps us reach people who are more interested in Dyson products. So if you visit a Dyson website you may see our advertisements on other sites. This is known as re-marketing or behavioural advertising and is used to make our advertising more relevant to your interests. We refer to these cookies in this policy as "Targeting Cookies".
We also combine information collected from cookies with any records we may have of you as a customer of Dyson. For example, we combine information collected from cookies with personal information you share with us, or information from Dyson products, for the profiling and statistical analysis of product popularity, of your behaviour when you use a Dyson website or of how Dyson products are used.

Types of cookies used by Dyson

Cookies fall into two general categories: first party cookies (which we set) and third-party cookies (which are set by third parties).
First-party cookies
These cookies are set by us at Dyson. For the most part, they enable essential functionality on our website. They also include our own Web Analytics cookies, which we use to understand how our websites are used by visitors so that we can improve them.
Third-party cookies
Third-party cookies are not set by Dyson, but by selected third parties with whom we work. Some of these third party cookies enable useful services, for example online questionnaires or Live Chat (which lets you ask questions of a Dyson expert). Others may be set by advertising networks we work with to keep track of your browsing activities, so that they can place our online advertisements in the most appropriate places. In the section below on "Managing cookies", we explain how you can change your settings so that third parties (including advertisers) know that you do not want to be tracked.
Social media cookies
Some pages on our websites let you share our content through social media sites like LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. Sometimes we may embed videos from sites such as YouTube. These sites set their own cookies, which we don't control. Those social media sites may have their own cookies policies, which, if available, would normally be contained on their websites. You should carefully review those cookies policies to make sure that you are happy with them.
Cookies falling within the three categories above can be further categorised depending on if they are session cookies or permanent cookies.
Session cookies
These cookies expire when you close your browser (or if you stay inactive for a certain time). They are used on our e-commerce websites so that you can continue browsing without losing what you put in your shopping basket.
Permanent cookies
These cookies persist even when the browser is closed. They’re used to remember you so that you don’t have to re-enter passwords and login information every time you visit a website.
You can find more information about some of the individual cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them here.

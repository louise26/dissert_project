We obtain information from credit reference agencies about your financial history so we can assess creditworthiness and product suitability, check your identity, manage your account, trace and recover debts, and prevent criminal activity. We’ll exchange information about you with credit reference agencies on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time. Credit reference agencies will share your information with other organisations. Your data will also be linked to the data of your spouse, any joint applicants or other financial associates. The identities of these credit reference agencies and the way they operate are explained in more detail at https://www.equifax.co.uk/crain
We sometimes make automated decisions based on personal information you’ve supplied or we’ve collected from others about you. This helps us to make sure the decisions we make are quick, fair and correct based on what we know about you. These automated decisions can affect the products and services that we may offer you. We’ll make sure human intervention is possible where there are any concerns about the decision. We want to make sure decisions about automated decisions such as credit approval are fair and transparent. We use technology to make decisions automatically or to build profiles about you. This technology uses logic that analyses your preferences and how you use our products and services, which helps us to improve your customer experience, making it more relevant for you and allowing you to get the most out of our products and services. What this means for you is that you’ll regularly receive from us personalised content (offers, promotions, TV programmes recommendations etc.).
We also use technology to make decisions automatically based on your credit score analysis. What this means for you is that we’ll decide your eligibility for our products and services based on your credit history. When we perform a credit search, we’ll leave a footprint of that search on your credit record.
We’ll search the files of a credit reference agency, which will keep a record of that search, when you apply for service. Additionally, details of how you conduct your account with us may also be disclosed to the credit reference agency. This information may be used by other organisations in assessing applications from you and members of your household.
We review customer accounts for possible fraudulent activity and provide information to fraud prevention agencies about customer accounts we suspect are fraudulent

Before we can provide certain services, products or financing to you, we undertake checks for the purposes of verifying your identity and preventing fraud and money laundering. These checks require us to process personal data you’ve provided, we’ve collected from you, or that we’ve received from credit reference agencies (like Equifax) or fraud prevention agencies (like CIFAS). Details of the personal information that will be processed may include a combination of name, address, date of birth, contact details, financial information, employment details and device identifiers including IP address.
We and fraud prevention agencies may also enable law enforcement agencies to access and use your personal data to detect, investigate and prevent crime.
We process your personal data on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in verifying your identity and preventing fraud and money laundering in order to protect our business and to comply with laws that apply to us.
If you don’t become one of our customers, we’ll still keep the result of our fraud checks about you if it’s in our legitimate interests to help prevent or detect fraud. We retain this information for 1 year.  Various fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time, and if you’re considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to 6 years.
The personal information we’ve collected from you will be shared with fraud prevention agencies who will use it to prevent fraud and money-laundering and to verify your identity. If fraud is detected, you could be refused certain services, finance, or employment.
If you tell us you’re associated with someone else financially (for example, by marriage or civil partnership), we’ll link your records together. So you must make sure you have their agreement to share information about them. The agencies we share the information with also link your records together and these links will stay on your and their files – unless you or your partner successfully asks the agency to break that link.
As part of the processing of your personal data for these purposes, decisions may be made by automated means. This means that our systems may decide that you pose a risk if our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with money laundering or known fraudulent conduct, is inconsistent with your previous submissions or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity. You have rights in relation to automated decision making if you want to know more, please contact us.
If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services, products or financing you’ve requested, or to employ you, or we may stop providing existing services, products or financing to you.
A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, products, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us or visit the CIFAS website for further information www.cifas.org.uk
Whenever fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area, they place contractual responsibilities on the organisation receiving it to protect your information to the standard required in the European Economic Area. They may also make the organisation receiving the information subscribe to ‘international frameworks’ aimed at sharing information securely.

We use profile information to help us develop our business, for marketing purposes and to personalise your experience with Virgin Media
We use profile information to help us develop our business, for marketing purposes and to personalise your experience with Virgin Media
We use information we collect from you directly and through your use of our products, networks and services and, in some cases, combined with information we collect from other sources, such as data brokers, to create a profile of you or to place you into groups or segments. These profiles are used:
·       to help us develop our commercial and marketing strategies, financial budgeting and forecasting activities. We use your information in this way relying on the Legitimate Interests Legal Basis (managing and developing our business are our legitimate interests).
·       to design personalised offers and communications that are most relevant to you and to personalise your experience (improving your experience/relationship with Virgin Media, providing more relevant products, services, communications and experiences and developing our business are the legitimate interests relevant here). We only send you direct marketing communications where we have your consent.
Some of the processes we use to create and refine these profiles use automated technology and, in some cases, are enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) technology, but they don’t produce decisions which create legal or similarly significant effects for you. You can contact us if you’d like more information on how we use automated or AI-enabled technology to process your personal information.
We acquire data from third parties to inform and develop our profiles. The third parties are listed below with information about how you can contact them to exercise your information rights:

We can show different ads to different TV users based on what we assess to be their likely interests.  We don’t deliver these tailored ads on an individual basis, but rather to a group of multiple households using household and set top box information and based on likely or predicted interests.   We rely on the Legitimate Interests Legal Basis to use your information in this way (providing customers with more relevant ads and growing our business are legitimate interests).
To enabled tailored ads, we work with:
·       Companies who engage us to deliver ads on their behalf or on behalf of other organisations
·       Ad provisioning companies who provide services under contract with Virgin Media to deploy the ads and provide reports to us
·       Data services companies who categorise our customers (by household and set top box ID, and no other information) into interest categories.
We work with Sky to enable their AdSmart service.  Please visit Sky’s privacy policy for more information about AdSmart.  If you’re a Virgin Media customer and still have questions about AdSmart and how your information is used, please contact us using the details below.
If you’d prefer not to receive tailored ads, you can turn off tailored ads on your TV by going to the settings on your set top box/TV device. If you do switch tailored ads off, you’ll still see ads but they won’t specifically match your likely interests.

We may share your information with debt collection agencies where there’s an outstanding debt owed on the account. We do this so that they can use the information, alongside other information that they hold, to attempt to contact you on our behalf so that we can recover the debt. In some cases, where we have been unable to recover the amount owed, we may sell the debt to a third-party debt management company. You’ll be informed when this takes place. Following the sale of the debt, any questions you have about communications you receive should be directed to the company in question.

Identifying prospective customers through social media advertising
To market our products and services to prospective and existing customers, we rely on the Legitimate Interests Legal Basis to share information with social media advertising partners (growing our business is our legitimate interest). We share aggregated information (information that does not identify you) and, in some cases, your email address with our social media advertising partners so they can identify people that have similar interests as yours (known as lookalike audiences), to target those other people with Virgin Media offers and promotions. Where your email address has been provided, the advertising partner will promptly delete your information as soon as they’ve identified the lookalike audience. Users of these social media platforms can change their ad settings by reviewing the social media platform’s privacy policy and privacy settings.

Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling
We sometimes make automated decisions based on personal information you’ve supplied or we’ve collected from others about you. This helps us to make sure the decisions we make are quick, fair and correct based on what we know about you. These automated decisions can affect the products and services we may offer you. We’ll make sure human intervention is possible where there are any concerns about the decision. We want to make sure decisions about automated decisions such as credit approval are fair and transparent. We use technology to make decisions automatically or to build profiles about you. This technology uses logic that analyses your preferences and how you use our products and services, which helps us to improve your customer experience, making it more relevant for you and allowing you to get the most out of our products and services. This means you’ll regularly receive from us personalised content (offers, promotions, TV programmes recommendations etc.).
We also use technology to make decisions automatically based on your credit score analysis, which allows us to guarantee your regular payments for our products and services. This means we’ll decide your eligibility for our products and services based on your credit history.
You have the right to object to our use of automated decision making in some circumstances.  Please remember that if you object to certain types of automated decision making, it may affect our ability to provide you with the optimum level of customer service and our ability to provide you with certain products, financing and services.  To find out more about your rights to object to certain kinds of processing, please visit the ‘Right to Object’ section below for more information.
